/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>{&#39;data&#39;: [&#39;I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw\nthe other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.&#39;,
  &#34;A fair number of brave souls who upgraded their SI clock oscillator have\nshared their experiences for this poll. Please send a brief message detailing\nyour experiences with the procedure. Top speed attained, CPU rated speed,\nadd on cards and adapters, heat sinks, hour of usage per day, floppy disk\nfunctionality with 800 and 1.4 m floppies are especially requested.\n\nI will be summarizing in the next two days, so please add to the network\nknowledge base if you have done the clock upgrade and haven&#39;t answered this\npoll. Thanks.&#34;,
  &#39;well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after\nstarting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i\&#39;m in the market for a\nnew machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...\n\ni\&#39;m looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch\nof questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:\n\n* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook\nintroductions are expected?  i\&#39;d heard the 185c was supposed to make an\nappearence &#34;this summer&#34; but haven\&#39;t heard anymore on it - and since i\ndon\&#39;t have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had\nmore info...\n\n* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the\nones the duo\&#39;s just went through recently?\n\n* what\&#39;s the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing\na 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don\&#39;t really have\na feel for how much &#34;better&#34; the display is (yea, it looks great in the\nstore, but is that all &#34;wow&#34; or is it really that good?).  could i solicit\nsome opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth\ntaking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize\nthis is a real subjective question, but i\&#39;ve only played around with the\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\n\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\n\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i\&#39;ll post a\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\ncorner... :( )\n--\nTom Willis  \\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\    Purdue Electrical Engineering&#39;,
  &#34;\nDo you have Weitek&#39;s address/phone number?  I&#39;d like to get some information\nabout this chip.\n&#34;,
  &#34;From article &lt;C5owCB.n3p@world.std.com&gt;, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker):\n\n\nMy understanding is that the &#39;expected errors&#39; are basically\nknown bugs in the warning system software - things are checked\nthat don&#39;t have the right values in yet because they aren&#39;t\nset till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code\nand possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew\n&#39;ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it&#39;.&#34;,
  &#39;\n\n\n\n\nOf course.  The term must be rigidly defined in any bill.\n\n\nI doubt she uses this term for that.  You are using a quote allegedly\nfrom her, can you back it up?\n\n\n\n\nI read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass\ndestruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.\nThe first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be\nallowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to\nconsider another class.\n\n\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;There were a few people who responded to my request for info on\ntreatment for astrocytomas through email, whom I couldn\&#39;t thank\ndirectly because of mail-bouncing probs (Sean, Debra, and Sharon).  So\nI thought I\&#39;d publicly thank everyone.\n\nThanks! \n\n(I\&#39;m sure glad I accidentally hit &#34;rn&#34; instead of &#34;rm&#34; when I was\ntrying to delete a file last September. &#34;Hmmm... \&#39;News?\&#39; What\&#39;s\nthis?&#34;....)&#39;,

Some PC use this set up too.\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n \nBy your OWN data the &#34;Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI&#34; is correct\nWith a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed\n&#34;20% faster than IDE&#34; {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been\nposted to this newsgroup in my Mac &amp; IBM info sheet {available by FTP on \nsumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as \nmac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}\n\nPart of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI\nis which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip\nan Apple salesperson said &#34;it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip&#34; {Not at a 6MB/s,\n10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra\nuses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see\nSCSI-1 interface and think \&#39;SCSI-1\&#39; when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven\nin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH\nFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.&#39;,
  &#39;I have win 3.0 and downloaded several icons and BMP\&#39;s but I can\&#39;t figure out\nhow to change the &#34;wallpaper&#34; or use the icons.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\n\nThanx,\n\n-Brando&#39;,
  &#34;\n\n\nI&#39;ve had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,\nbut not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,\nthe owners of the board&#39;s compression technology. (I&#39;m writing this\nfrom memory; I&#39;ve lost the reference. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.)\n\nUsing the board, I&#39;ve had problems with file icons being lost, but it&#39;s\nhard to say whether it&#39;s the board&#39;s fault or something else; however,\nif I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,\nthe icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing\nproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress\na board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.\n\nSince Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes\nin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.\nWhich is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac&#39;s product since\nthey&#39;re being so stinky. (But hey, that&#39;s competition.)\n-- &#34;,

  &#39;\nYep, that\&#39;s pretty much it. I\&#39;m not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (-&gt;Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don\&#39;t really know what the &#34;created\nin His image&#34; means. I\&#39;ve heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ\&#39;s example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only &#34;know&#34; Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is &#34;wrong&#34;. Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The &#34;wrongness&#34; here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is &#34;inappropriate&#34;\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:&#39;,

  &#39;\n   {Description of &#34;External Tank&#34; option for SSF redesign deleted}\n\n\nYo Ken, let\&#39;s keep on-top of things! Both the &#34;External Tank&#34; and\n&#34;Wingless Orbiter&#34; options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today\&#39;s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O\&#39;Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the &#34;giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,&#34; and building a &#34;station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.&#34;\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday\&#39;s Times).\n\nOption &#34;A&#34; - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses &#34;Bus-1&#34;, a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\&#39;s\n     qualified for STS and ELV\&#39;s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&amp;C\n     Communications, &amp; Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A &#34;Power Station Capability&#34; is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an &#34;arrow mode&#34; to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners\&#39; labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability &amp; EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA &amp; ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption &#34;B&#34; - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option &#34;B&#34; team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option &#34;A&#34;). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options &#34;A&#34; and &#34;B&#34;.\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics &amp; Re-supply).\n  -  A &#34;Two Fault Tolerance Capability&#34; is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.&#39;,

  &#39;\nDon\&#39;t be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during\nWorld War II.  If you\&#39;re prepared to say &#34;Let\&#39;s round these people up and\nstick them in a concentration camp without trial&#34;, it\&#39;s only a short step to\ngassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally\nonly intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly\nbecause they couldn\&#39;t afford to run the camps because of the devastation\ncaused by Goering\&#39;s Total War.  Those who weren\&#39;t gassed generally died of\nmalnutrition or disease.\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nI certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\nvery well.  That\&#39;s not my point.  I\&#39;m &gt;philosophically&lt; opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs\&#39; poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs\&#39; inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they\&#39;ll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, &#34;It\&#39;s not me I\&#39;m worried about- it\&#39;s all the\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n&#34;The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be &gt;sure&lt; that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now.&#34;\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can\&#39;t read &gt;every&lt; TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won\&#39;t- some that I might have to\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\ndon\&#39;t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)&#39;,

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\&#39;s office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n&#34;If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the \&#39;85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n&#34;If you buy the Porsche 924, we\&#39;ll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it\&#39;s another story again - we\&#39;ll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.&#34;\n \n&#34;But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\&#39;t make sense.&#34;\n \n That\&#39;s what the book says.  We don\&#39;t insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.&#34;\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\&#39;s entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.  When I was &lt;26 many years ago (10 years) I bought a Trans\nAm (new).  Insurance was about $1300/year.  When I turned 26, it immediately\ndropped to $460/year.  I had not had any accidents before or after, this was\nstrictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I\nsold the car 2 years ago.  My F-150 pickup is about $80/year less.\n \nThe real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age 25, I felt SO MUCH MORE\nRESPONSIBLE than I was before...  :-)\n \nWes\n \n======================================================================== 21\n \n \nFor your information:\nCalifornia\nMale, single, under 25 , No moving violation\nAlfa Spider\n     =======&gt; $2000 / year\n \nWhat a bargain!!!\n======================================================================== 28\n \nLet\&#39;s see, I\&#39;m 24, single, male, clean driving record.

  &#39;I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is\noutput from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of\n100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed\nmore easily into a personal-computer-based ADC data\nacquisition card.\n\nMight anyone be able to point me to references to such\ncircuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but\nI am not sure how well they work in practice.\n\nIn this case, I\&#39;d like something which will amplify sufficiently\n&#34;nicely&#34; to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees\naccuracy or better).&#39;,
  &#39;QUESTION:\n  What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal\nconfiguration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system \nto the TCP/IP access control list?   \n\n  BACKGROUND:\n  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&amp;T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT\&#39;s X11R4 and \n2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  \n  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the\nsame time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP\nAccess Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  \n  I\&#39;ve tried to get &#34;xhost&#34; to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong\nor the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  \n  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the \nNCD boots.

  &#39;\nI think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he\ngot traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn\&#39;t Rick Vaive the captain of\nthe Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for\nEd Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that\nDarryl Sittler was their captain (he\&#39;d torn the &#34;C&#34; off his\njersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he\nwas traded to the Flyers.\n\nOh yeah, of course, Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before\nhe was traded wasn\&#39;t he? &#39;,

  &#39;\n       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \nboiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There\&#39;s a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\&#39;s\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about &#34;thermal \npollution&#34; de-icing a river, said, &#34;Up here, we view heat as a resource&#34;.  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.&#39;,
  &#34;Doug Roberts - Ken Hill for NL MVP!!\n\t       Let&#39;s go &#39;Spos\n&#34;,
  &#39;\nYes.\n\n(I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service.\nPlease keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack\nenvironmentalism)\n\nA half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will\nrarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more\npowerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.\n\nSatan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something\nother than God\&#39;s intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the\nhealth of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You\nthink he\&#39;s going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,\nit is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is\nnot God\&#39;s intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is\nGod.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.\n\nI see two facets of a response to it:\n\n1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is\n   God\&#39;s intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because\n   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not\n   constitute what the Apostle Paul called &#34;becoming all things to all men so\n   that by all possible means I might save some.&#34;\n\n   Don\&#39;t say &#34;Forget the environment, I\&#39;ve got important things to spend my time\n   on.&#34; - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your\n   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.\n\n2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not\n   creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and\n   glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords\n   woven in the infinite tapestry.&#39;,
  &#39;\nIt depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities\non gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying &#34;unsafe&#34; econoboxes\ninstead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only\nthing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.\nI figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren\&#39;t common enough\nfor me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are\nlots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.&#39;,
  &#34;\nThe front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car\nstereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units \nserial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I \ndon&#39;t know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people\nwho damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.\n\nAs to deterring theft:\n\nWhen I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800\nnumber.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most\npeople who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that\nmatter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck\nthey couldn&#39;t use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial\nnumbers do catch theives.&#34;,
  &#34;My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I\nbought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably\nenough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to\nget some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a\ndoctor&#39;s-prescription only treatment but is not available over the\nchemist&#39;s counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say\neither his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil\nis OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His\nfather was the same, so I don&#39;t figure his acne is going to escalate\ninto something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about\ntheir appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour&#39;s son had this wierd\nmalady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from\nacne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.\n\nMy son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort\nof teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a\ncouple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to\nmake the condition worse, not better.\n\nShall I bury the kid till he&#39;s 21 :)\n&#34;,

  &#34;\nHow do you define war?  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages\ncount as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?\nJanuary, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold\n               1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,\n                    after cutting off the supply lines to it.\nAttacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.\nBy Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from\n      land links with the rest of the Jewish population.\n         The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,\n            while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were\n            slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.\nJerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from\n     Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side\n     of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews \n     had been killed.\n\nOf course, this isn&#39;t war, since it&#39;s only the Arabs attacking.\nJust like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets\nagainst Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?\nWill it still be &#39;Intifadah&#39; when the PLO brings in tanks?\n\n\n&#34;,

  &#39;\nFunny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out\nVanbiesbrouck\&#39;s mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect\nof:\n&#34;You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask \nand he can\&#39;t stop a beachball!&#34;\n\nYou may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard\nit.&#39;,
  &#39;Oh boy, a little K-bike versus /2 scuffling? Grow up! And that goes for\nthe both of you!\n\nI do hope that the &#34;dump dempster&#34; campaign works however.\nI think that he is a crook, and I am suprised that it has taken this long\nfor anything to be done (though obviously, it ain\&#39;t over yet)\nOn the other hand, \nI\&#39;m not sure that I want to be in bed with ANY of the wackos running.\nThrowing $20.oo down a rathole might be more effective than sending it in\nto the club. You wouldn\&#39;t get anything, but you don\&#39;t get anything now.\n\nThe magazine you say? Ever since the MOA politburo installed Don it has\nlacked any sort of panache it may have had. \n\nAh, but what would I know? I own a /6 AND a K-bike\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nI agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as\nproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far\nas it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal\nof letting LE wiretap &#34;terrorists and drug dealers&#34; is to restrict\nstronger techniques.  \n\nWiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or\n(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be\ntapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption\nclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the\nintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong\nprivacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system\nexpressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The\nmere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.\n\nThe stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping\ncapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic\ncryptography, and only by this restriction.  &#34;Clipper&#34; appears to be\nno more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We\nwould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public\nat large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but\nmost people seem to think that an `assault weapon\&#39; (as the NYT uses\nthe word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who\nwants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about\ncryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be\nlabeled &#34;too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need&#34;.\n\n\nWhat they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will\ncontinue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul\nlaw or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other\ngrounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They\ncould levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the\nhands of the BATF, who as we\&#39;ve seen you really don\&#39;t want on your\ncase.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most\nlikely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was\nrequired because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute\nunconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a\ntextual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances\nAct of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away\nwith it.\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n\tThe word is &#34;subrogation.&#34;  Seems to me, if you\&#39;re willing to wait\nfor the money from scumbag\&#39;s insurance, that you save having to pay the\ndeductible.  However, if scumbag\&#39;s insurance is Scum insurance, then you may\nhave to pay the deductible to get your insurance co.\&#39;s pack of rabid, large-\nfanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurance\&#39;s lawyers.\n\n\tSad, but true.  Call it job security for lawyers.\n\nLater,&#39;,
  &#39;/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / vincent@cad.gatech.edu (Vincent Fox) / 10:34 am  Apr 14, 1993 /\n\nThis isn\&#39;t rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I\ncan\&#39;t resist....\n\n\nSometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....\n\n\nI can\&#39;t imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\n\n\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\n\n\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you\&#39;ve got one of those\n\&#39;new fangled\&#39; hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it\&#39;s unnecessarily\nredundant.  I\&#39;d rather have the extra round.\n\n\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\nthan magazines though.\n\n\nTrue, but this is a training function.\n\n\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt\&#39;s for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I\&#39;ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\&#39;t cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I\&#39;ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I\&#39;ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI\&#39;ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more \&#39;fragile\&#39; then semi auto\&#39;s.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\&#39;re out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\&#39;s &#34;The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.&#34;\n\nIn general, I\&#39;d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn\&#39;t going to train them, they aren\&#39;t going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\&#39;t bother.\n\nFor myself, I\&#39;d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\&#39;d rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\&#39;m wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I\&#39;d be arguing for revolvers. :-)&#39;,
  &#34; \n\n\n\nTed, you&#39;re missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn&#39;t have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year&#39;s suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat&#39;s downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you&#39;d probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the\ndifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I\nwould think that you&#39;d reconsider your thoughts.\n\n\n                                    -Sean\n\n&#34;,

  &#34;For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush\nthe Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How&#39;s this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro&#39;s ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn&#39;t look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team&#39;s only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it&#39;s not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn&#39;t sound bad when you&#39;re averaging three runs/game\nand giving up 6.6/game. \n\nStill, it&#39;s early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today&#39;s game\nwith California was cancelled.&#34;,
  &#34;\n: In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?\n: Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does\n: Toronto have?\n\nWell, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does\neveryone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded\nspot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters\nthan lefthanded batters.  I just don&#39;t understand why people insist\non lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).\nMost batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have\nthe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.\nI guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams\nmay be more vulnerable to LHP&#39;s than RHP&#39;s.  However, this is probably\nonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters\nfor this reason during the regular season.\n\nI think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of\nwhether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have\nhigher ERA&#39;s than righthanded starters, precisely because managers\ngo out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of\nthe platoon advantage).\n\nAm I missing something here?&#34;,
  &#34;Of course, if you want to check the honesty of your dealler, take it in\nknowing what&#39;s wrong, and ask them to tell you. :)\n\nOf course he&#39;ll probably know right a way, then charge you a $20 service\nfee. :)&#34;,

  &#39;\n\nThat\&#39;s why zoologists refer to you as a \&#39;fecal shield\&#39;. Colonel Semen \nM. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the \nArmenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish \nwomen, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia \nin June 1919 that\n\n&#34;the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist\n and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys\n of whatever power happened to be ascendent.&#34;\n\nIn September 16, 1920, Major General W.

  &#39;an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to\n&#34;sport&#34; mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does &#34;sport&#34;\nmode entail?  several things:\n\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\n\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\n\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\n\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\&#39;s\n\tanother curve approaching)\n\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\n\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\n\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\n\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\n\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\n\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\n\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\n5 speed)?  \n\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\&#39;m sure there will\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\n&#39;,

  &#39;Archive-name: space/new_probes\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $\n\nUPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES\n\n    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below\n    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\&#39;s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\&#39;s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\&#39;s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\&#39;s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\&#39;s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn\&#39;s rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned\n    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to\n    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have\n    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data\n    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from\n    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve\n    approximately 70% of its original objectives.\n\n\t   Galileo Schedule\n\t   ----------------\n\t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle\n\t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby\n\t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback\n\t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby\n\t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled\n\t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage\n\t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby\n\t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby\n\t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage\n\t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby\n\t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation\n\t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver\n\t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons\n\t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter\n\t   07/18/96 - Ganymede\n\t   09/28/96 - Ganymede\n\t   12/12/96 - Callisto\n\t   01/23/97 - Europa\n\t   02/28/97 - Ganymede\n\t   04/22/97 - Europa\n\t   05/31/97 - Europa\n\t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration\n\n\n    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90.

Operations will start 11/93 for\n    one martian year (687 days).\n\n\n    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched\n    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\n\n\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\&#39;s north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\&#39;s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\&#39;s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that\&#39;s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter\&#39;s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

We don&#39;t know if it actually\napplies to reality, we don&#39;t know if anything in the world is infinite.\n\n\nYou don&#39;t know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another\nmathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain\nway.\n\n\nI have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It&#39;s a man-made concept, and\nlike many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had\na different understanding of it.\n\n\nPrecicely. We don&#39;t even know if infinity applies to reality.\n&#34;,

  &#34;.d.\n.d.\nI just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it&#39;s definately not because\nof *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur&#39;im, a Jewish celbration of joy\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \nlying about (you couldn&#39;t swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\npeaceful solution.)  &#39;Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\nmind...\n\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\nintended for.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\nkill by their leaders.\n\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man&#39;s history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I&#39;m off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao&#34;,

The atrocities committed by the Armenian \n volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the \n Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the \n fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many\n Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with \n accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian \n guerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of\n war then observed in such areas.[1]&#34;\n\n[1] &#34;Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d\&#39;Artillerie de Forteresse Russe \n     d\&#39;Erzeroum,&#34; 1919, p. 28.\n\n: &gt;honored me by reproducing my text.

Now, where is\n: your non-existent list of scholars? What a moronian. During the First \n: World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship \n: through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its \n: centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by \n: savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from \n: their 1,000 year homeland.\n\n\nHow could you? Because there is none.\n\n\nLike conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I \nam writing. By the way, that &#34;bullshit&#34; is justly regarded as the first \ninstance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.\nFor nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived \non their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet \nand Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The \nArmenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its \nMuslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the \nremainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, \nTurkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. \n\nThe survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and \nKurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its \npredecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against \nhumanity.\n\nx-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims \nby admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.\n\n\nYou may assert whatever you wish.\n\n\nDitto.\n\n: The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance\n: of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.\n: This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, government\n: and international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark \n: Bristol, ...\n\n\nAnd still anxiously awaiting...\n\n: .......so the list goes on and on and on.....\n: \n: &gt;I\&#39;m still trying to find out about those Jews in LATVIA.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian\n success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of\n Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common\n soldiers began deserting in droves.&#34;\n\n&#34;With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of\n World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman\&#39;s enemy\n increased drastically.

I\&#39;am arguing about \n: the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?\n\n\nIt could be, perhaps, your head wasn\&#39;t screwed on just right. In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\&#39;s policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an &#34;encore&#34;\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n&#34;in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.&#34; \n\n\nCome again?\n\n: &#34;These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

This is with religious\nattention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in\nexactly the same manner..\n\n  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)\n  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)\n  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles\n  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)\n  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles\n  6. Two timing belts.\n  7. Constant error signals from computer.\n\n  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging\n     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done\n     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because\n     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4\n     weeks to get because it is on national back order. \n\n     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new\n     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.&#39;,

  &#34;Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety of\nprograms, and have had problems off and on with lock up,\nbut now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory\nover a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is \nlocking up Everytime.  I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have\ntried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of\nvideo memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386,\nhave tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to\nprevent swapping) and I have REM&#39;d ALL TSR&#39;s and utilities in config.syus\nand autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling\nmy HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,\nno TSR&#39;s, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still\nlocks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except\n3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows\nscreen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out\nof ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks\ntom branham\nbranham@binah.cc.brandeis.edu\n&#34;,
  &#39;\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\&#39;s ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur\&#39;an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of &#34;fasad&#34;. This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of &#34;fasad&#34; can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n&#34;crisis&#34;. But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on &#34;fasad&#34; was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.&#39;,
  &#34;\nNo answer.\n\n\nI do not feel like the cameras were out of range.  Cameras watched the first \nconfrontation.  Cameras watched the banners.  Cmaeras watched the final \nconfrontation with tanks.  Cameras watched the fire.  When weren&#39;t cameras \nable to watch?  When would cameras be unable to watch people coming out with \ntheir hands up?\n\n\nWell, that is what BATF should have done.  Either, Koresh would have gone \npeaceably as he has done in the past, or perhaps it was already too close \nto the apocalypse in his own mind.  It is hard to predict the actions of \na leader who would not release the children when most rational people would.\n\nNow will you answer my question up top?\n\n\n&#34;,

  &#39;\nassuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of\na large inline 4 that doesn\&#39;t have balance shafts.  i guess toyota\ndidn\&#39;t care about &#34;little&#34; details like that when they can brag about\nthe mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.\n\nmyself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or\nrecommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no\nbalance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you\never want a halfway decent engine.  \n\nif the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do\nexcept to sell it and get a V6.\n&#39;,
  &#34;\nHowever, also be aware that Implementor&#39;s notes are basicly\nrecommendations, they are *NOT* part of the spec.  As others have\nnoted, many vendors (including SGI) violate this.  Indeed, the main\npoint is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and\ntherefore &#39;noise&#39; on the bus.&#34;,
  &#34;\nI think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I don&#39;t think it is the\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\n\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\n\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\n\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\n  between MSC and BC).\n\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\n  references).\n\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS&#39;s\nhype about portability to other vendor&#39;s compilers will be just that.\n&#34;,
  &#39;\nHi Noel,\n\nI\&#39;ve made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,\ntriangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic\n3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.\n\nThe problem I\&#39;m currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which\ntriangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited\nto convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code\nexample of how to do it.\n\nAnother way to do the bartman may be\n\n- TGA2POV\n- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.\n\n  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript\n  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,\n  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it\&#39;s still open\n  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.\n\nExample:\n\nobject {\n   union {\n      height_field { gif &#34;abp2.gif&#34; }\n      height_field { gif &#34;abp2.gif&#34; scale &lt;1 -1 1&gt;}\n   }\n   texture {\n      Glass\n   }\n   translate &lt;-0.5 0 -0.5&gt;      //center\n   rotate &lt;-90 0 0&gt;             // rotate upwards\n   scale  &lt;10 5 100&gt;            // scale bigger and thicker\n   translate &lt;0 2 0&gt;            // final placement\n}\n\n\nabp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing &#34;ABP&#34; black on white in\nTimes-Roman 256 points.\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nIs this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:\n\n\n Source: &#34;Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6&#34;\n\n Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately \n forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi \n collaboration.\n\n A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft\n is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The \n magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany\n and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the\n magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,\n is attention-getting.\n\n This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically\n important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be\n an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. \n\n In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain\n political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They \n occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.\n The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered \n &#34;Aryan&#34; and what befell them.\n\n\nSerdar Argic&#39;,
  &#39;\nNot hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but\nthis hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.\nI\&#39;ve seen some application note from Philips that used one of their\n8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram\nthat was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.\n\nAnother alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller\nchips that &#34;create static RAM appearance&#34; and all that, but they may\nbe too expensive to make it worthwhile.&#39;,
  &#34;As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  \nlate.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \ncan&#39;t reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF&#39;s in the same  \napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \nneed to re-boot.\n\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \nGPF&#39;s).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\n\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn&#39;t. \n\nI haven&#39;t tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF&#39;s  \nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\n\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF&#39;s on After  \nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \ngdi.exe.\n\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\n\n-Eric&#34;,

  &#39;Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.\n\n Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to\nClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers\n To: National Desk, Defense Writer\n Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of\n          the United States, 202-479-2258\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers\nAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense Base\nRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give\nsufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close\n56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.\n   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of\nCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, including\nSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA\&#39;s executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested &#34;concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today\&#39;s relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service\&#39;s Total Force of the future.&#34;\n   He asked the commission &#34;to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action.&#34;\n   &#34;Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed,&#34; wrote Hultman.  &#34;The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations.&#34;\n   Hultman reminded the commission, &#34;The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis&#34; that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted &#34;that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.&#34;\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve\nCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,\nBillings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.\n   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El\nToro, Calif., plus six others.\n -30-&#39;,

Yeah,\nthey depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then\nthey bottom out. Got my &#39;86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for\njust under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost\n16K miles onnit....that&#39;s about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.\n\nThink the &#39;86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. \nIf that&#39;s the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere\n$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to\ndepreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of\nthe bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about\nHarleys holding their value better doesn&#39;t always wash away the\nknocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) \n\nAccording to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a\nreal dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

  &#39;\n   Anas Omran has claimed that, &#34;the Israelis used to arrest, and\nsometime to kill some of these neutral reporters.&#34;  The assertion\nby Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  If there is an\nonce of truth iin it, I\&#39;m sure Anas Omran can document such a sad\nand despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another\npiece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does\nnot know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran\nwould care to retract this \&#39;error\&#39; I would be glad to retract the\naccusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I\nwould again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing\nto do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n&lt;lots more deleted&gt;\n\nI think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much\nmore about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and\nsome of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,\nin a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their\n54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin &#34;equivalent time&#34; or in &#34;real time&#34; sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\&#39;s actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you\&#39;re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******&#39;,

  &#39;\nUmm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert\nunbalanced 1/4&#34; jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher\nquality. You\&#39;ll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from \nRadio Sh#$&amp;^t to convert from RCA to 1/4&#34;. Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy\ntransformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.\nYou can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.\nThe benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component\nwith the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.\n&#39;,

  &#34;\nWhere does the shadow come from?  There&#39;s nothing close enough to block\nsunlight from hitting them.  I wouldn&#39;t expect there to be anything block\nour view of them either.  What am I missing?&#34;,
  &#39;First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter\nat hand.  All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend\nfound out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my\nmail, I quit from the mail reader &amp; went about my business.  I must have\ntrashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next\nday &amp; saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he\nplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before\nrealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he\napologized for reading my mail &amp; said that he did not want to appear to be\na snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &amp;\ndidn\&#39;t mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither\nchanged his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he\nknows where I\&#39;m coming from &amp; now I know where he\&#39;s coming from.  And all\nthat I can do is pray for him, as I\&#39;ve always done.\n\nI believe the reason that he &amp; I &#34;click&#34; instead of &#34;bash&#34; heads is because\nI see Christianity as a tool for revolution, &amp; not a tool for maintaining\nthe status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God\nthan he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. \nChristianity &amp; religion have been used as tools to separate my people from\nthe true knowledge of our history &amp; the wealth of our contributions to the\nworld society.  The &#34;kitchen of heaven&#34; was all we had to look forward to\nduring the slave days, &amp; this mentality &amp; second-class status still exists\ntoday.  I, too, have rejected\nan aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much\nhypocricy exists behind the walls of &#34;God\&#39;s house&#34; beginning with the\nimages of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &amp;\nraise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where\nI can feel comfortable &amp; at-home, but I don\&#39;t see it happening anytime\nsoon.&#39;,
  &#34;mjs&gt;No No No No!! All I am saying is that you don&#39;t even need to tell people\nmjs&gt;the technique of countersteering, cos they will do it intuitively the first\nmjs&gt;time they try to go round a corner.\n\nkarr&gt;Are you sure?  Remember that you *can* get around corners without\nkarr&gt;countersteering.  In fact, my Experienced Rider Course instructors\nkarr&gt;claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike\nkarr&gt;turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight\nkarr&gt;around, even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite\nkarr&gt;direction.  (I admit I&#39;ve never actually seen this.)\n\nI&#39;ve experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...\n\nMy first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,\nI would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas\nsteady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding\nwithout any hands.  If I needed to turn, I&#39;d shift my weight into the\nturn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!\nGranted, it wouldn&#39;t turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn\na bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input\nto the bar normally associated with countersteering.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any\ninput they&#39;re giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that\nmay be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,\npossibly for years at a stretch, I can&#39;t think of anybody who&#39;d argue\nthat this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar\nin a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.\n\nExcept maybe for Mr. Sixsmith...  ;^)\n\nMr. Bill&#34;,
  &#39;\n\n    Sure. I can give is a shot...\n\n\n    You need to get the 30-pin simms.\n\n\n    If you mean in a &#34;newer, more powerful&#34; Mac system then the answer\nis no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and\nno longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.&#39;,
  &#39;At the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson\noffers the following &#34;paraphrase&#34; of John 3:16:\n\n   &#34;God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,\n   to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life.&#34;\n\nThe &#34;to die in our place&#34; bothers me, since it inserts into the\nverse a doctrine not found in the original. Moreover, I suspect that\nthe poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic\n(or penal) substitution.  I maintain that the Scriptures in speaking\nof the Atonement teach a doctrine of Substitution, but not one of\nForensic Substitution.\n\nThose interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my\nessays on Genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7\n(with lead-in).

That&#39;s the part that makes me nervous too.  Who gets to decide if\n:I am a threat?  Based on appearance?  Would someone feel more threatened\n:\nActions determine whether someone presents a threat... and I don&#39;t carry a gun\nso much for people, cause I tend to fade if there are any about, but due to \nseveral encounters with formerly domestic dogs...  these critters ain&#39;t scared\nof folks, and can get aggressive.\n\n:on staying at and saw someone sitting there cleaning his gun.  Softly I backed\n:away, and hiked another 5 miles to get *out of there*.  I&#39;ll freely admit it here:\n:I&#39;m not afraid of guns; I&#39;m afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry.\n:\nI&#39;d count that as a fear of guns... somebody having the sense to keep their\nweapons maintained isn&#39;t as likely to present a threat.  The Army taught me to\nclean any weapons DAILY, since they usually need it, regardless of whether \nthey&#39;ve been used... You&#39;d be amazed how sweaty a holster can get, or how much\ntrail dust will get in it.  And I guess you&#39;d be scared of me and my former\nExplorer Post... seems the advisors were National Guard Special Forces grunts,\nand considered it heresy to be out in the woods without a weapon... course, \nusually you wouldn&#39;t notice &#39;em... :)  They tended to avoid public scrutiny...\n\n:Of course, that may be the way to solve the solitude problem.

  &#34;I feel childish.\n\n\nWho mentioned dirtbikes? We&#39;re talking highway speeds here. If you go 70mph\non your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.\n\n\nBecause it wouldn&#39;t be a Jeep if it didn&#39;t. A friend of mine just bought one\nand it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that&#39;s\nbecuase it&#39;s a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it&#39;s written in about ten places that\nthe windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they&#39;ve made\nit a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit\nthat it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the \nhighway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they&#39;re\nprobably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest\nprimarily to bikers.\n\n\nNotice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the \ntwo parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see \nbikers wear goggles on the street. It&#39;s either full face with shield, or \nopen face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of \nbicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound \nsunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.\n\n\nOk, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the\npoint. I&#39;ve been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean\nmy shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered\nmess) and I&#39;d see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight\nt-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really\nspecific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that \nsplattering bugs with one&#39;s face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?\nImage? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?&#34;,

  &#39;\n\nWell, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, \nthe fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted \nand participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because \nof race, religion and national origin?\n\nAs in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and \nidiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A \nshort-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda \nand anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious \nfor the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their \nneighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely \nwithin Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to \nx-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \nthe historic homeland and the \&#39;cradle\&#39; of the artistic and literary \nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \neven lunatic. \n\nAnd we still demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \npolitical pressure.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \n\nNow what would you do? \n\nSource: \&#39;The Sunday Times,\&#39; 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:&#34; That\&#39;s when\nthe real  slaughter began,&#34; said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. &#34;The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.&#34;\n    &#34; They were shooting, shooting, shooting&#34;, echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam\&#39;s morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nSerdar Argic&#39;,
  &#34;\nYou&#39;d need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume\nno new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with\nlower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don&#39;t want to\nbuild something HLV-sized anyway.&#34;,

  &#34;know \nhe \nnow.\n\nAnd Michael Jackson, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Cosby wouldn&#39;t be \nmaking near as much money if they weren&#39;t entertainers.

Again, Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard\nworking citizens (and much more than Rickey Henderson for that\nmatter). \n\nwhen the\nmillion--also,\n\nThe reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks\nstart making the real big salaries late in their career, when they\nare on the decline.

  &#39;\nI was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many\nverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been\nshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)\nChristians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion\nof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well\nas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses\nand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We\nmust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the\ninterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with\nthem.&#39;,
  &#39;\nA(&gt;  Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is\nA(&gt;  dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?  One Dr. says no, the\nA(&gt;  other (not his specialty) says the first is negligent and that another blood\nA(&gt;  test should be done.  Also, what is a good diet (what has worked) for a hypo-\nA(&gt;  glycemic?  TIA.\nA(&gt;  \nA(&gt;  \nA(&gt;  Anthony Anello\nA(&gt;  Fermilab\nA(&gt;  Batavia, Illinois\n\n   Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the proper \n   channels, you might consider ther following:\n\n   1) Chelated Manganese   25-50mg/day.\n   2) Chelated Chromium    400-600mcg/day.\n   3) Increase protein through foods or supplements.\n   4) Avoid supplements/foods high in Potassium, Calcium, Zinc.\n   5) Avoid Vit C supplements in excess of 100mg.\n   6) Avoid honey and foods high in simple sugars.\n   7) Enjoy breads, cereals, grains...\n\n   Discuss the above with your health practitioner for compatibility\n   with your body chemistry and safety.\n\n   --Ron--&#39;,

  &#39;\n   Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means\n   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I\n   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an\n   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently\n   decided the beemer wasn\&#39;t worth stealing, but did try the next night to\n   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.\n   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.\n\n\nI know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the\nthings that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I\&#39;ve\nheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\nGuzzis and other relative &#34;exotics&#34; since there isn\&#39;t a large demand\nfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems\nthat the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes. \n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\n\nI would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of\nthe squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting\nany treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though &#34;accepted&#34;, may\nnot be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\nsignificantly inflated by these &#34;quacks of a different color&#34;.  In fact, I\&#39;d\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\non these &#34;quacks&#34; instead of devoting unbelievable energy on \&#39;search-and-\ndestroy-missions\&#39; to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\n\n\n***************************************************\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\n***************************************************\n\nLately I\&#39;ve seen the word &#34;quack&#34; bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say &#34;quack-quack&#34; and\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\n\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  &#34;quack&#34; is a nebulous word\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\nscary.\n\nBut what do I know, I\&#39;ve already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\nnewsgroup as being \&#39;anal retentive\&#39;, and \&#39;psychotic\&#39;.  I look forward to more\nnet.diagnoses.  Hey, they\&#39;re free.\n\n\nJon &#34;Quacks \&#39;R Us&#34; Noring\n\n\n(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on\nthe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and\ntheories, such as the &#34;yeast theory&#34;, should create your own moderated group.\nYou can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you\ncan keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member ---&gt;&gt;&gt;  INFJ Club.&#39;,
  &#39;My suggestion would be to contact Microsoft about the Video4Windows SDK.\nYou would need to call Developer Services at (800)227-4679 extension 11771\nfrom 6:30am to 5:30pm Pacific time.\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n[...]\n\nWait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US \nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \nfrom the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \nwe &#34;invaded&#34; Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \nSpain.\n\nSo if you mean by the word &#34;invaded&#34; some sort of military action where\nwe cross someone\&#39;s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\n&#34;invaded&#34; carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\n(If some nation &#34;invades&#34; the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of\nview, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).\n\n[...]\n\nNo, it\&#39;s someone who believes in &#34;peace-at-all-costs&#34;.  In other words,\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\n\n&#34;Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,&#34; you ask?  Well, it depends\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\nthan life itself; if you\&#39;d rather die fighting for liberty than live\nunder a tyrant\&#39;s heel, then yes, it\&#39;s &#34;bad&#34; to be a peace-nik.\n\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\nnot like them to be &#34;bad&#34; and &#34;unconscionable&#34;.  I would not have any\nargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and\nstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with \nthe national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to\nlegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and \nmany times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank\nhypocrisy!)  All to stop we &#34;warmongers&#34; who are willing to stand up \nand defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do\nso requires a strong national defense.\n\nTime to get off the soapbox now.  :)\n\n[...]\n\nRegards,&#39;,
  &#34;\nActually, an apostle is someone who is sent.  If you will, mailmen could\nbe called apostles in that sense.  However, with Jesus, they were\ndesignated and were given power.  Remember that there were many\nthousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did.  That didn&#39;t make them\napostles, though.&#34;,

  &#39;gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables\nbut I want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors.

  &#34;Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object,\nbeyond Pluto&#39;s orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii. They\nnamed the object Karla.\n\n\tThe program said the object wasn&#39;t a gaseous giant planet, and\nshould be composed by rocks and ices.\n\n\tCan someone confirm these information? Could this object be a\nnew planet or a Kuiper object?\n\n\tThanks in advance.\n\n\tFrancisco.&#34;,
  &#39;\nIt was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it \nwithout notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible \nenough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving\nthem to their fate.\n\nThe point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices\nabove its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for\nthe sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land\nin a poor situation.  \n\nI don\&#39;t know if others share this opinion.  It is mine,\nand I\&#39;m sure there are some who agree and some who don\&#39;t\nThe way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances \nbeyond their control, in that since they didn\&#39;t own the land,\nthey didn\&#39;t have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the &#34;greater \nArab unity&#34; the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews\n(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just \nbusiness.   \n\nThe purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for \nJewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose, \nthe sales were legal, so I really don\&#39;t see any grounds for \ncontesting them.&#39;,
  &#39;Archive-name: space/schedule\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $\n\nSPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE\n\n    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM\n\n    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,\n    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version\n    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)\n    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The &#34;Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,&#34; ASC G&amp;C 2102,\n\n\t&#34;During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.&#34;\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it\&#39;s couched in NASA jargon. I\&#39;ll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t&#34;relative wind&#34;) and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (&#34;a negative q-alpha&#34;).\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t&#34;downward&#34; force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force &#34;alleviates structural loading.&#34;\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\&#39;re about the\n\tmost &#34;delicate&#34; part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn\&#39;t roll (&#34;performance gain&#34;).\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (&#34;decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity&#34;).\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (&#34;improved S-band look angles&#34;).\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, &#34;Why isn\&#39;t the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?&#34;  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the &#34;top&#34;\n    [Orbiter side] and the &#34;bottom&#34; [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\&#39;s.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V\&#39;s also had a roll program.  Don\&#39;t ask me why -- I\&#39;m a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the &#34;roll\n    maneuver&#34; is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a &#34;quaternion,&#34; a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can\&#39;t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It\&#39;s worth asking if yours doesn\&#39;t.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

  &#39;\n\n\n\n\nDo you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\nNero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents\nhave decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \n\n\nPeter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what\nthe Bible says.   \n\n\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n&#34;I am.&#34; \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness\&#39;s\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  &#34;I am&#34;.  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.&#39;,

  &#34;\nthe classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a\nliberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight\nevangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources\ntry Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while\nblatently non christian explore where technology may be going.\n\n\nThis is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of\nrelated to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter\nwent and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the\ntechnology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)\n\n\nWhen lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class\nabout the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights\nthat they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your\nfaith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example\nfriends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the\nwife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God\nwilling).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to\ndecide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology\nis against God&#39;s revealed word.\n\nRegards\n David&#34;,

  &#39;\ni did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a\ncouple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as\ni could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the\nbible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.\nin the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of\nsatan as a (excuse the pun) &#34;devil\&#39;s advocate&#34; for yahweh.  see the\nbook of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_\nreferences to &#34;lucifer&#34; in the bible except for a mistranslation of\n&#34;the morning star&#34; in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which\nprobably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as &#34;the\nsun king&#34; referred to louis xiv.  \n\nall in all, i don\&#39;t know where the story _came from_; it may have been\nrolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have\ninvented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am\nin a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the\nother stuff i found out....

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist\nwho has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following\nare reasonable conclusions:\n\n1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.\n2. The cause it not understood.\n3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.\n4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but\nthere have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with\nany of these experimental drugs.\n5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.\n6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes\nabates or goes away after a few months.\n7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.\n8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.\n9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on\nsomething else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.\n10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.\n11.  I&#39;m sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there\nis not.&#34;,

Dyer Computer Consulting, Cambridge MA\n   References: &lt;20996.3049.uupcb@factory.com&gt; &lt;79727@cup.portal.com&gt;\n   Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 18:43:05 GMT\n   Lines: 18\n\n   &gt;I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity\n   &gt;which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring\n   &gt;from the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal\n   &gt;results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these\n   &gt;chemicals than other people.  I don\&#39;t remember any connection being made\n   &gt;with seizures, but it certainly couldn\&#39;t hurt to try an all-natural diet.\n\n   Yeah, the &#34;Feingold Diet&#34; is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD\n   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and\n   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents\n   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their\n   children\&#39;s development.  So much for the value of &#34;interesting anecdotal\n   results&#34;.  People will believe anything if they want to.\n\n   -- \n   Steve Dyer\n   dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n\n\nThanks for all the interest in this problem of mine. I don\&#39;t think it\nis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown\nany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.\nShe has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.\n\nThe fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made\nby Kellog\&#39;s makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to\nsomething in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our\nimmediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running\nnose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history\nincluding some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. \n\nAnyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body\nchemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures\neither.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of\nrelief.  Thanks again.\n&#39;,
  &#34;\n\n\nIncluding all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way\nthrough a corner??\n\n\nAgreed!\n\n\nThis is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree to\ndisagree?? I still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turn\nto the right is unnecessarily confusing, when they&#39;ll do it anyway if they\njust get on the bike and ride the damn thing.\n\n\n\n\nMe too!!\n\n:-)\n\n\n\n\nJeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I\nthought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway\nlocomotives...\n\nThe official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the\nfront brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being\nthat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In\npractice I suspect most people do what you describe.\n\n\nIf you don&#39;t slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you&#39;ve\nachieved maximum braking or not. I&#39;m not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. &#34;,
  &#34;This is turning into a FAQ\n\n\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\nmemory.\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\n \n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine&#39;s SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT&#39;T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount&#34;,

  &#39;\n\n  &gt;Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if\n  &gt;they want to go at least 9600 baud)?\n\n  &gt;Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason\n  &gt;I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from\n  &gt;wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get\n  &gt;a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.\n\nIf Apple didn\&#39;t put out such a good product -- I\&#39;d gladly take my\nbusiness to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.  I think the\nsituation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business.\nI\&#39;ve had mine on order since January.  Apple finally called me last\nweek -- to tell me that I should have it &#34;by the second week of May.&#34;\nIn the meantime, I\&#39;ve been stuck with my Duo210 without the\nconnectability I needed it for.  I\&#39;m sure there are plenty of people\nwho can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is\nright or at least justified, but I\&#39;m just a crabby consumer and\nwhen I order a &#34;Duo210 with modem&#34; that\&#39;s the product I expect.\n\nOh, well.

  &#39;\nAs a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\nthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive &#34;T&#34; is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to &#34;Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa&#34; but I haven\&#39;t seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive &#34;optical isolator&#34;.. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a &#34;T&#34; switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

  &#34;  ...\n\nI think this is a big leap sex-&gt;depression.  One example is myself,\nwhere no sex-&gt;depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,\ndepression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say \ndepression-&gt;promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come\nfrom emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and\npromiscuity is used as an escape.\nSince I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an\nemotional bond, I don&#39;t see a problem with sex before (not outside of)\nmarriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as\nwhat is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just \nmy opinion.&#34;,

Cosmicly, we don\&#39;t even exist for all practical purposes.\nI can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.\nIt would just say: &#34;don\&#39;t bother.&#34;\n\nLuckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talk\nabout. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.\n\n\nBut the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar and\ncountless others is still with us, although their works have perished.\n\nBut they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,\ntheir deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if they\nare utterly forgotten.\n\n\nOne day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, which\nI do not)\n\nBut in that time we can make a difference.\n\n\nIn the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all the\npoint you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobody\nto ask, &#34;Gee, I don\&#39;t think James Sledd\&#39;s deeds are gonna make\nmuch of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?&#34;.\n\nBut they will have already have made a difference, great or small,\nbefore the end.\n\nWhy must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?\n\n\nLittle is in the eye of the beholder, of course.\n\n\nI don\&#39;t doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. And\nit does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.\n\n\nI would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely my\ndefinitions.

Cogito Ergo Sum\nand all that.\n\nPerhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:\n&#34;Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.&#34;\n\nWhich is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.\n\n\nHave on. If reality is an illusion, isn\&#39;t True Reality an illusion\ntoo? And if True Reality is spirit, doens\&#39;t that make Spirit an Illusion\nas well?\n\nIf I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.\n\n\nThat is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.\n\nDo you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so?

If not, please explain how this\ncan give a purpose to anything.\n\n\nHow does it do that?\n\nWouldn\&#39;t the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation for\nsome *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.\n\n\nWhat pressure?\n\n\nIt is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless your\ngoals either include doing so or require doing so before they\nthemselves can be achived.\n\nIndeed, many people have set goals for themselves that\ndo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Check\nout yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is not\nat all the same thing.\n\n\nWhy is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in this\ngoal? To you? To God?

  &#34;You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than\nin DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using.\n\nTry the following:\n   1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The\n       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine\n       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.\n\n   2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART&#39;s (8250 or 16450)\n       can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART&#39;s (16550) can\n       buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.

  &#34;\nSo in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out\nthe Penguins, that&#39;s immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,\nJoe, think about what you&#39;re saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\nWhy they played them is what&#39;s irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\nof comparing two goaltenders.\n\n\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you&#39;re a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn&#39;t see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn&#39;t tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn&#39;t have a game like that in him.\n\n\nDon&#39;t be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don&#39;t say too much on the good side either. I&#39;ve seen\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\nDom has played well too.\n\n\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\nKasper...\n\n\nMostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain\nautographs on the team photos.

  &#39;\n\n\n\nWell, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just\ntugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying\nto recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to\ngo the \&#39;right\&#39; way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those\nsackcloth and ashes?\n\n[I was not and am not \&#39;pretending\&#39; anything; I am *so* pleased you are\nnot surprised, though.]\n\n\nNote that I didn\&#39;t say it was perpetual motion, or even that it\nsounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was &#34;sounds almost like\nperpetual motion&#34;, which I, at least, consider a somewhat different\npropposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should\nbeg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?\n\n\nI will believe that this process comes even close to approaching\ntechnological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the\ntrash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of\nseparating things first and having a different \&#39;run\&#39; for each\nactinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull\n(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,\ntechnological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this\none with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it\&#39;s possible\nand the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable\napproach? \n\nAnd I still wonder at what sort of \&#39;burning\&#39; rate you could get with\nsomething like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would\nreally recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power\nwith and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,\nor tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of\nmaterial and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,\nweeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a\nnon-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?\n\n\n-- \n&#34;Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\&#39;t have the balls to live\n in the real world.&#34;   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden&#39;,
  &#39;To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of \narrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine\nmyself to answering the charge of illogic.\n \n\n\nThis is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,\ntaught to think. It is the fundamental premis &#34;A is not not-A&#34;. If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word &#34;believe&#34;,\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. &#34;I believe Tom went to \nthe library.&#34; (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. &#34;I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.&#34; (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\nand wants.\n\n\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\n\n\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\n \n\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\n\n\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other\&#39;s words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \nas in error.&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nIt\&#39;s all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg\nsubnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don\&#39;t\nseem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound\ndigitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce\nvarous bit-rates. There\&#39;s one which gives pretty acceptable voice\nquality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.\n\nTheir DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn\&#39;t\nneed to play &#34;two-way-radio&#34;. You can also download code to the DSP\nsubunit, though you\&#39;d need a software development kit for the DSP in \nquestion [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own \nvocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.\n\nPaul&#39;,

What\nbit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I\&#39;ve heard that some\napplications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly\nto the screen (or something like that).

  &#39;\n\nMSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is\npure, the source should not be a problem.

  &#39;\n\n\tWhy do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a\nphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?\nThe answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person\ncannot.\n\n\tI acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,\nbut I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)\nI hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your \nradio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is\nnot healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and\ntaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.\nThat is God.\n\n\tOf course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,\nhow do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or\na lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force\nourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us\nenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think\nwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us \nenough to help us through this world?\n\n\tI also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When\nI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, \nbecause it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see\nthe results in the long term, I find that He has led me\nin the proper direction, even though it did not feel right\nat the time.  This is where our works as Christians are\nimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,\nexcercises of faith make the faith strong.  \n\n\tAs for you, no one can &#34;convert&#34; you.  You must\nchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to\nfollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with\nyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,\nwe have to accept your decision, although we always keep\nthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find out\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\nabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to\nunderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the\nlogic of this world.\n\n\tMay the Lord bring peace to you, &#39;,

  &#39;A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  \n\nQuestion #1\n\nAccording to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is\n\&#39;unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a \n&#34;concealed and dangerous weapon.&#34;  There is no statutory provision for\nobtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.\&#39;\n\n*  Jury instructions indicate that \&#39;to go armed\&#39; one must have a firearm\non one\&#39;s person or within his immediate control and available for use.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how \&#39;open\&#39; does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?&#39;,
  &#39;\n[DG] THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM: A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE\n[DG] by Theodore J.

On ground where no monument yet\n[DG] marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all\n[DG] races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a\n[DG] massive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false\n[DG] version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American\n[DG] members of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of\n[DG] tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\n[DG] campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\n[DG] in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\n\n[JAKE] After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first\n[JAKE] impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.\n\nJake, I\&#39;m really disappointed in you.

  &#34;\nI think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part\nabout the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that\nthe important part of what the original poster said was the bit\nabout killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the\nsightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw\nit just as poetic license, but it&#39;s understandable that others\nmight see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit\nstrong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:\n\n  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it&#39;s a good idea to\n  #do a little homework, or at least think.\n\nwas unnecessary.\n\n\nThroughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit\nassumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual\nanti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech\non why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you&#39;re\nreading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not\ntrue in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets\nthrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the\nstate of Israel.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d rather be somewhere else, so I&#39;m outta this thread.&#34;,
  &#39;\nI don\&#39;t think such a Canada is any more &#34;culturally similar&#34; to\nthe United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual\nrights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely\nrelated to crime) Canadian laws parallel England\&#39;s and differ\ngreatly from those of the United States.\n  \n\nActually, they do not have &#34;roughly the same... urban economy&#34;, \nand extremely different ethnic composition.\n\n\nHowever, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,\nthe difference disappears completely: Seattle\&#39;s minorities are\npredominatly poor, while Vancouver\&#39;s are middle or upper class.\nThe rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,\nwhile the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three\ntimes as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.\nThe pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not\none of gun control.\n\n\nThat is a gross distortion: &#34;Self-defense&#34; does not mean killing\nthe attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \nattacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that\n0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every\ncase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence\nwhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.\n(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,\nbased on the National Crime Survey\&#39;s estimate of 80,000\ncrimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other \nstudies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.\nThose figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences\ninvolve killing the attacker.) \n\nSo, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) \ncases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted\nin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in\ncomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides\nmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study\nconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides\nprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be\nclose to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.&#39;,
  &#39;According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal &amp; a few\nothers have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.

The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but\nI got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.\n\nHowever, I still have a few complaints:\n- when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop\n  pattern) jerks up and down for a few times.\n- the Quantum 170 drive is noisy\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!\n\n--&#39;,

  &#34;: From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger)\n\n: Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to\n: stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to\n: the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for\n: the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As\n: it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been\n: for them, I&#39;m sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.\n\nIn the UK, it&#39;s impossible to get approval to attach any crypto device\nto the phone network.  (Anything that plugs in to our BT phone sockets\nmust be approved - for some reason crypto devices just never are...)\n\nI was wondering some time ago how big a market there was for good old-\nfashion acoustic coupler technology to build a secure phone :-) ... is\nit possible to mask out all the real voice well enough so that none of\nit strays into the mouthpiece?  Perhaps a well-sealed coupler attachment\nthat was as well blocked as possible, then a white noise generator on\nthe outside to muffle any real speech?&#34;,
  &#39;\n\nInstead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,\nif that\&#39;s way too difficult to you, here are some hints.\n\nIndeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on\nthe local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie\nthat your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will\ndo? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some\n&#34;facilitations&#34;? Of course, you won\&#39;t want to wait until they get the\napproval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation\nbetween two child molesters, because meanwhile those two child\nmolesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,\nthere should be some way for them to get access to those keys\n-quickly-, right? Like, they could have a copy of the database, and\nworry about a warrant later...\n\nRegards,\nVesselin&#39;,
  &#39;-*-----\n\nThese effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new\ntreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by \nperforming studies that are &#34;blind&#34; in various ways.  Some of these\nare:\n\n  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a \n     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the\n     control group or the test group.\n\n  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects \n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\n  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects\n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\nObviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to \ndifferentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis\nis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on\nwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  \n\nIt is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are\nanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because\nthose who performed the study did not &#34;blind&#34; themselves.  It is not\nconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already\nare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,\nthe control and test groups are treated alike.&#39;,
  &#34; \n \nThe argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in\nthe almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are\nconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and\nnot an entirely different source.\n \n \n \nWe are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual\nexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider\ntheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke\nthat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).\n \nAs it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke&#39;s text. The evidence\nfor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.\n \n \n \nWhen they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on\nputting John after the rest of the three?\n \n \n \nSure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be\nfine. So what&#39;s that supposed to say? Am I missing something?\n \n \n \nThat John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language\ntogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument.\n \nThe argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel\nof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?\n \nOne step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that\nto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.\nNot even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.\n \n \nIn other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like\nand arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.&#34;,

  &#39;The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,\n1993 issue of USA Today (&#34;Drug Use Up At Younger Age&#34; by Mike\nSnider, p. 1A).\n\n    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -\n    usually 13 - and they\&#39;re using more LSD and inhalants like glue\n    and air fresheners, says a new survey.\n\n    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds\n    &#34;statistically significant increases&#34; in eighth-graders\&#39; use of\n    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.\n\n    &#34;We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing\n    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters\n    adolescence,&#34; says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief\n    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and\n    Human Services.\n\n    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long\n    decline.\n\n    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the\n    following in the 30 days before they were polled:\n\n        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;\n                         cocaine 0.7%.\n\n        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;\n                         cocaine 0.7%.\n\n        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;\n                         cocaine 1.3%.\n\n    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants\n    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.\n\n    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%\n    over 1991. \n\n    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%\n    tried it in the last year.\n\n    Reducing drug use among students &#34;requires a different kind of\n    strategy&#34; that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part\n    of an overall illness prevention plan.\n\n    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders\n    disapprove of them.\n\n    &#34;It\&#39;s scary,&#34; Shalala says.  &#34;Dealers are focusing on younger, more\n    vulnerable kids.&#34;\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot&#39;,
  &#34;\nFor goodness sake if they had fired a cruise missile at the compound more\npeople would have come out alive. It was obvious to anyone with the remotest\ncontact with reality that such an outcome was likely (not just possible)\nhowever the fire started. As, Mr Lawnmower, you seem to have already entered\nyour own little virtual reality I guess you can&#39;t be expected to understand\nthings in the real universe.&#34;,
  &#34;\nNo. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat,\nconfig.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File\nmenu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other\nprogram&#39;s .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.\n\nI wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was\njust a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The\nreason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals\nabout this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry\nunder the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for\ninternal use only. It&#39;s kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice\nmulti-file replacement for Notepad.&#34;,

  &#39;Hello all,\n\nYou, the Net, are my last resort, or I\&#39;ll just change my job :-)\nThis might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven\&#39;t seen any.\n\nSys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with\nserials/paral/floppies and \n\t- IDE controller &#34;clone&#34; Gw2760-EX\n\t\tthere are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( \n\t- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3&#34; 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).\n\nPb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):\n\t- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, &lt;15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages\n\t\tthe real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)\n\t- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.\n\t\t(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,\n\t\tand BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)\n\nGoal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks \nsimultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be \na nice bonus but is not expected.\n\nUltimate goal: have room for Linux et al.\nEx of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount\nthe ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.\n\nI have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,\nor can coexist witout hang-ups but can\&#39;t access the ESDI or the IDE, \ndepending on setup/jumpers.\n\nUseful suggestions might be:\n- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD\nis expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).\n- Do I need some driver to make it work?\n- --- &#34; --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?\n- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE\nis cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I\&#39;m not \nrich or I wouldnt\&#39; try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.\n- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change\na chip or put a jumper!\n\nAlso useful:\n- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.\n- ftp archives with relevant info.\n- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven\&#39;t\nseen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)\n- any hints into inner workings of the system ... \n- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )\n\nDirect or posted replies are ok.\n\tMany thanks,\n\t\t\tCat.&#39;,
  &#34; \n \n(Deletion)\n \n \nYou have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument.\n \nAnd chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It\nrather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system\nwithout checking if they suit the description.\n \nAnd wasn&#39;t the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according\nto Islamic law?\n \n \n \nNo, I even believe what I don&#39;t like. Can you give better answers than that?\nHave you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims?\n \n \n \nA fact, if memory serves. And most will see the connection between the\nprimitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.\n \n \nAs usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex\nnor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important\npoint, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even\nstronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The\nconsequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids.\nPlease note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex\nis not controlled is completely counterfactual.\n &#34;,
  &#34;\n\nAs a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he\nshould abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience\nforbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate\nthis system of government-sanctioned slavery.\n\n\nIf our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY)\nand choose to stay out of other people&#39;s wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia),\nwe would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn&#39;t the jobs be replaced by\nimproving our domestic situation?  (I&#39;m not for continued deficit spending,\nbut if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I&#39;d rather they improve the \ninfrastructure than fight other people&#39;s wars.)\n\n\nA novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing\ndecommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper\nthan building them from the ground up (Denver&#39;s new airport is one of the \nmost appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in\nmy lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I&#39;m sure Bill Gates\nor Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the\nmoney from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.\n&#34;,
  &#39;\nWomen\&#39;s pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too\nshallow to use!\n\nI is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when\nshe goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from\nwould be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who\nas a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).\n\nPuting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes\nyou rear look wide as a cows!\n\n Also, to have the habits that\nwork for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater\nwhat you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)\n\nA women\&#39;s suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,\nnone on the inside). I have men\&#39;s coats that have as much as 6\npockets! This is definitally not fair!!!\n\nAs one that wears both men\&#39;s and women\&#39;s clothes, I can tell you,\nwomen\&#39;s clothes have few if any funtional pockets!\n\nWhen dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and\nmy keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent\nthan the pants pockets and looks better.\n\nHaving a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is\nparamout to a woman\&#39;s safty. Men don\&#39;t see this as a problem.\nA woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.\nImage some red necks yelling at you &#34;We are going to FUCK YOU!&#34;\nand the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight\non you!)\n\nIf you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!&#39;,

Larger get more or ??\nBasically make the prize (total purse) $6 billion, divided amngst the class\nwinners..\nMore fair?\n\nThere would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events,\numpire and such and watch for safety violations (or maybe not, if peopel want\nto risk thier own lives let them do it?).&#39;,

  &#39;GB&gt; From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks)\nGB&gt; &gt;(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic).\nGB&gt; I hope you meant &#34;inarguably&#34;.\n\nGiven the choice, I would rather argue &lt;g&gt;.\n\nNo arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is\nthat aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of\nLeao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and\nsecondary neuronal ischemia).\n\nMigraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic\ncolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients\nthey can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill\nmy office with patients holding their heads in pain.&#39;,

The Assumption of our\nBlessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the\nredemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not\nASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along\nwith Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in\nHeaven.

  &#39;Hello src readers,\n\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: &#34;You have nothing to do with the Church.&#34;  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called &#34;the nature of the incarnate word&#34;,\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures &#34;human&#34; and   &#34;divine&#34;  that are   united in   one &#34;without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration&#34; (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures &#34;did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye&#34; (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\&#39;t  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile &#34;semantic&#34; differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  &#34;To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.&#34;  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    \&#39;-------------------------------------------------------------\&#39;\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren\&#39;t.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn\&#39;t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.&#39;,

So overall I&#39;d figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.\n    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system\n at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the\n speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060.

  &#34;Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of\nCivil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings\nattached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that \nverdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or \ninnocence in a traditional sense, so be it.

  &#39;\n  Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is\nprobably the weakest evidence.\n\n  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out\nby the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of\ndetailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used\ntoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the\nexistance of Jesus, only of his activities.\n\n  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the\ngospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a\nsource).&#39;,

BUT, also in the release notes,\nnothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I\nsupposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,\nbut not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can\nbe used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but\nI&#39;m *really* confused.\n-- \nmike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu &#34;,

  &#34;\nActually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel\nreserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift\nastronaut or something like that).  But yes, you&#39;ve got the idea -- the\nreboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.\n\n\nSomebody has to build that thruster module; it&#39;s not an off-the-shelf\nitem.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\nattitude control (HST&#39;s own is not strong enough to compensate for things\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\ndata from HST&#39;s own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\ndon&#39;t want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\nthrusters and the like).\n\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\nreboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well\nsuited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing\na lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was\nrelatively short, so it got cancelled.&#34;,

  &#39;: From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff)\n: Message-ID: &lt;1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu&gt;\n: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\n: would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\n: probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.\n\nI think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.\nCurrently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record\ncalls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants\nand listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this\nstrategy wouldn\&#39;t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\nin the near term.)\n\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\&#39;d be surprised\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\n\nNote that that doesn\&#39;t mean I think it won\&#39;t be done if technically\nfeasible.  Just as I\&#39;m sure many wiretaps are done now without\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\&#39;t ever be presented to a jury.\n\nWhile I\&#39;m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\narchiving scenario to extremes, read &#34;Lacey and his Friends&#34;, a\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\&#39;t worry folks, it\&#39;s\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\nget to it.  And by the way, we\&#39;ll be installing cameras on all major\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\nteller machines, don\&#39;t we?\n\nAnd then we\&#39;ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\&#39;ll make it a crime ever\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\nafter.  But, see, there\&#39;s still a right to privacy.  We haven\&#39;t\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\&#39;d\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\n\nAnd hey, nobody\&#39;ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\n\nAfter all, if you\&#39;re not doing anything illegal...\n\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\&#39;t elminate all\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \nI can\&#39;t imagine why.\n&#39;,

  &#39;We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. \nFor the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   \nalways used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      \nfilter to strip out the &lt;LF&gt; characters.                                        \n\nUntil recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   \na result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   \nat the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  \nto streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  \nallow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            \n\nI understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC \nproduct (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       \n\nI have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that\nours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?

  &#34;I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely\nMicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC.

  &#34;\nIn fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a\nproject.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don&#39;t have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.&#34;,

  &#39;Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain\nchemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,\n(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized\nexample), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\n\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.&#39;,

  &#34;All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year \nmoon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace \ndevelopment before.

I&#39;ve heard iodine causes trouble and that it  \nis used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be\nwhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease \non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\nmeat).\n\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm\nwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will\nhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it\nsoftens and washes off when it has a chance. That&#39;s why hair goes limp with\noilyness. \n\nBecoming convinced that the best thing to do with\na whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any\nprying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of\npimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won&#39;t\nbe an infection afterwards.\n\nTell him that it&#39;s normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry\nmakes it&#39;s money off of selling people on the idea that they are an\nincredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples). \n&#34;,
  &#39;Michael Bushnell writes;\n\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn\&#39;t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t&#34;Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.&#34;\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t&#34;I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son&#34;\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t&#34;For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.&#34;\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone &#34;to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.&#34;  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t&#34;Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.&#34;\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t&#34;The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\&#39;; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.\&#39;  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\&#39; and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\&#39;&#34;\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t&#34;The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,\&#39; and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\&#39; and `will\nreceive of mine,\&#39; so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t&#34;The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created.&#34;\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t&#34;Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources.&#34;\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the &#34;proceeds from the Father&#34; line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\nproceed from the Father.&#39;,
  &#39;\n  Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for &#34;cheap&#34;,\nbut I cannot get the source for &#34;cheap&#34;, hence I am limited to using whatever X\nlibraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of\nMotif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not\nseen it myself).\n\n  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which\nonly three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5\nlibraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the\nvendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same\nproblem when X11R6 becomes available.\n\n  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do\nnot have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,\nbut that sort of ruins the whole idea of &#34;free&#34;, doesn\&#39;t it?\n\n    Cheers,\n\n    Tom McConnell&#39;,

  &#39;\nHello,\n\n\tI understand this philosophy.  The bears are a national\ntreasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it\ndo so at their own risk.

They are not a national\ntreasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to &#34;allow&#34;\nprovision for defense against them would also &#34;allow&#34; provision\nfor defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided\nthat it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than\nto take a chance on threatening the bears.\n\n\tPersonally, I wouldn\&#39;t go into an area where I would be\n&#34;managed&#34; so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think\nof it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)&#39;,

  &#34;Sci.E(E) netters:\n\nI am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that \nrequires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working \nfine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so \ncheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any \nLCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I \nam looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about \n1000-10,000.\n\nMainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part \nnumber, or when they do look around for something in their line \nthey find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey&#39;s cheapest offering is $5 in \nquantity.\n\nI know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole \ncalculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it \nfor $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This \n$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, \nimport duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor \nchip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can&#39;t cost much.\n\nIf anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or \ndistributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.\n\n-Joe Betts\nbetts@netcom.com\n&#34;,
  &#39;\n\n\n\n\nThis is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is\nindeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor\nunfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made\nmostly of carbon and water is &#34;fair&#34;.\n\nHowever, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about\nthe fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily\nincludes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation);\nnot at all the same thing.\n\nGranted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral\nsentiment as near as I can tell.\n\nIf *your* idea of God &#34;condemns&#34; heathens to ordinary death, I have no\nproblem with that.

  &#34;\nActually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of\nscripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two\nconflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about\n(a).

  &#39;\nI do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with\n&#34;Kartagener\&#39;s syndrome&#34;, which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome\nin which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic\ninfections. &#34;Situs inversus&#34; means that organs are on the wrong\nside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the &#34;normal&#34; rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be &#34;random.&#34; People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan\&#39;t find the patient\&#39;s heart sounds (because they\&#39;re on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison\&#39;s, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\nabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your\npediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of\nwhich there is probably one at NCSU.&#39;,

  &#34;\n Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially\nlethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the\nmuzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or\nplastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the\nintent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i&#39;ve also\nseen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].\n Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the\ngravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to \nbe a proper reaction [and so does the law].  \n Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force\nhas its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the\nless effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some\nrisk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent \nsince the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be\nmore deadly.\n&#34;,

  &#34;I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.\na blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics\ncard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...\n\nUnfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing\ntransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any\nideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly\nappreciated.  \n\nOh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so\nI don&#39;t need a fast response time at all, however, I haven&#39;t found a\nway to take advantage of that fact.\n\nThanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,\nyou will have my undying gratitude.\n\n\nSteve Verity\n\n\n\n&#34;,

  &#34;The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn&#39;t know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.&#34;,

  &#34;Hello,\n\nI am planning on attending Podiatry School next year.\n\nI have narrowed my choices to the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric\nMedicine, in Philadelphia, or the California College of Podiatric\nMedicine in San Francisco.  \n\nIf anyone has any information or oppinions about these two schools, please\ntell me.

  &#39;Stuff deleted\n\nAll five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the\ndeath sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent,\nand aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise\nI agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.\nThe Qur\&#39;an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public\nor private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not\npunishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this\ntrend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but\nhistorically they are the exception.\n\nCursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of &#34;Shatim&#34;.\n&#39;,
  &#39;Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it\nat a game in Boston.  \n\nIt was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The &#34;Golden Triangle&#34;\n(Pgh\&#39;s downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along\nwith a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the \nother.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens\&#39; logo (the really\nfat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens\nlogo, and a space for the &#34;new&#34; (now current) logo.\n\nTommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it\nfor him.  \n\nBut while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The\nvery next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask\ndone in by a goalie\&#39;s superstition.&#39;,

  &#34;\nBuffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.\n\nPat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced\nto give it up (Ramsey&#39;s now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike\nFoligno (who&#39;s now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy\nRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who\nretired, so I guess that&#39;s where the streak started.  Or did it?\nAfter all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.\nJim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in\nreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I&#39;m\nnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit\nand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith\nseems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don&#39;t know if\nthe captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he\nplayed for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)\n\nCaptaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you&#39;re to be traded, almost,\nunless you&#39;re a franchise player.\n&#34;,
  &#39;\n\tJesus was born a Jew.  We have biblical accounts of\nboth his mother\&#39;s ancestry and his father\&#39;s, both tracing back\nto David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus\nwas Semitic.\n\tAs an interesting aside, Jesus\&#39; being semitic makes him\nneither &#34;white&#34; nor &#34;black,&#34; and in some sense underscores the\npoint made earlier that his color was not important, it was his\nmessage, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate\non.\n\tFinally, I would direct anyone interested in African\ninvolvement in the church to the account of the conversion of\nthe Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it\&#39;s chapter\n9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.  Because &#34;Ethiopia&#34; at that time indicated a region\njust south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not\nonly the first African Christian, but the first black Christian\nas well.  \nGod bless,\nCharles Campbell\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nTom\&#39;s right about this.  It\&#39;s only a grantable right if the granter has\nthe will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you.\nNever mind the legal status.\n\n\nNick\&#39;s right about this.  It\&#39;s always easier to obtain forgiveness than\npermission.  Not many people remember that Britain\&#39;s King George III\nexpressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian\nmountains.  Said subjects basically said, &#34;Stop us if you can.&#34;  He\ncouldn\&#39;t.\n\n\nThat\&#39;s how the USA started.  Of course, that\&#39;s also how the Bolivarian\nRepublic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn\&#39;t have\nquite the staying power of the USA.  I\&#39;m sure there are more examples of\ngoing far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right\nnow.\n\n\nOr do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to\ncarry out as &#34;scientific research&#34; which just coincidentally requires\nthe recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.\n\n\nLute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in\nthe late \&#39;70\&#39;s for his commercial space launch project (one of the very\nearliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise\nmissiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.\n&#39;,
  &#39;I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which\nI have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one \nof which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week\&#39;s\n_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles \nBourke, Corpus Christi\&#39;s pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT \ntranslation in the New American Bible.  He noted &#34;...certain practices have \nbeen introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, \nand sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.&#34;  I note that at my \nparents\&#39; parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the \noffertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word &#34;risen&#34;.  This was not a \nkiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.\n\nI wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a\nwhole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it\&#39;s moderated) conversation\non topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).\nSometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is\nthe exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems\nso...Christian?&#39;,

  &#39;\n\tIt is available through some dealerships, who in turn have to back\norder it from the manufacturer directly.  Each one is made to order, at least\nif you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5\&#39;, I believe).\n\n\n\tSee below\n\n\n\tI have a 6\&#39; long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she\ndoesn\&#39;t get out much anymore, so I don\&#39;t use the lock that often anymore).  It\nis made of 3/4&#34; articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.\nIt is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,\nprofessionals can open it rather easily:\n\n\t1) Freeze a link.\n\n\t2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).\n\n\t3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are\n\t\tfrightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.\n\n\tFor the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is\nanywhere from 1/2&#34; to 7/8&#34; thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded\nin a flexible covering to protect your bike\&#39;s finish, and has a barrel-type\nlocking mechanism.  I don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s adjustable, but my source says it\&#39;s\nmore difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat\nin bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8&#34; model).\n\n\tAll bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.\nEven the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.\n\n\tFYI, I\&#39;ll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.\n\nLater,&#39;,
  &#39;Here is a disturbing thought.\n\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\n\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\n\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\&#39;t put the whole\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\ndoubtless claim this can\&#39;t happen -- but we know that &#34;can\&#39;t&#34; is a\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\n\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\nevery person\&#39;s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\nneed the &#34;master key&#34; two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\n\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\nisn\&#39;t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\nsecrets, so he isn\&#39;t being completely irrational here (although why\nour companies couldn\&#39;t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \n\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\nfraction of the keys. You can\&#39;t avoid that sort of thing.\n\nDon\&#39;t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\nthe escrow databases.\n\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\&#39;t the sorts of secrets that our\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\nClipper chips.\n\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\ndoesn\&#39;t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\nthat they realize that they can\&#39;t put things off forever, but they can\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\n\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\nit all.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com&#39;,

  &#39;\nOne consideration to remember is that if you don\&#39;t turn it off now,\nyou may not be able to later.

  &#34;\nOf course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more\ndifficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in\nany way.

Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red\nSea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of\nthe Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.\nThe action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.\nEgyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been\ndenied their livelihood by the parted waters.

When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\npuncture, and of course, that doesn\&#39;t feel good.  A way to prevent\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 &#34; apart.)\n\nThis is from experience, so I hope it\&#39;ll help you.  (I have\ndiabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)\n\n\t\t\tLater,\n\t\t\t\tDavid&#39;,

  &#34;With all the talk about this Clipper chip, I have developed one question...\n\n\t\t\tHOW DOES IT WORK???\n\nIf you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the\nother party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to \nundo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for \nanother?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn&#39;t that mean that someone\nelse could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use\nwould be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems\nlike a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with\ncryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as\nto how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience with\nthis sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated. &#34;,
  &#39;[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]\n\n\nFirst of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing\npeople.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on\nwhom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed\npunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus\nto &#34;seek and save that which was lost&#34; (Luke 19:10)?\n\nYou asked for it.\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.\nMatthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in\nGod\&#39;s eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the\ndisciples &#34;will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out\nfrom the presence of the Lord&#34;.\n2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth\nbeing condemned.\nRevelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes\nand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe &#34;fiery lake of burning sulfur&#34;.\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n&#34;will be tormented with burning sulfur&#34; and there being &#34;no rest day or\nnight&#34; for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  &#34;The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God.&#34;\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I\&#39;m mostly playing &#34;devil\&#39;s advocate&#34;.  I\&#39;m not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit\&#39;s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\&#39;s possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term &#34;second death&#34;.  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere\&#39;s a wide enough variety of images that it\&#39;s possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don\&#39;t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\&#39;m aware that it\&#39;s possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\&#39;t eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn\&#39;t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as &#34;the second death&#34;.\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is &#34;everlasting destruction&#34;?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it\&#39;s at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn\&#39;t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn\&#39;t say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don\&#39;t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.&#39;,

  &#39;\nI\&#39;m not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  That is because your\npremises are wrong from the word &#34;Go&#34;.  You claim that Christianity is\nbased on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the\ncurrent thread on the evidence for Jesus\&#39; resurrection for evidence\nthat Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.\n\nFurthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs &#34;regardless of\nany evidence that you may find to the contrary.&#34;  Without any evidence\nto support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem \nargument.\n\nMind you, I don\&#39;t mean this as a personal attack.  I\&#39;m merely pointing out\nthe intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion.\nIt would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do \nbase their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to \nthe contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.\n &#39;,

  &#39;1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\n--------------------------------\nPlayoffs:\n---------\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\n\nBarry Melrose\&#39;s decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\nthe rookie goaltender.\n\n&#34;I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\nfun time of the year, and I\&#39;m not,&#34;  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  &#34;I\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.&#34;\n\nStauber said he accepts Melrose\&#39;s choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\&#39;t played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\&#39;s backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n&#34;If I\&#39;m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?&#34;  Stauber wondered.  &#34;Not that I\&#39;d be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.&#34;\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\&#39; &#34;goalie of the future,&#34; Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n&#34;Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\&#39;t do it,&#34; Melrose said.  &#34;An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn\&#39;t satisfied to be a backup.&#34;\n\n&#34;I\&#39;m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\&#39;re going to be No. 1, you\&#39;ve\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\&#39;ve got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.&#34;\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\&#39;t play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n&#34;I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,&#34; said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n&#34;What I\&#39;ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\&#39;t be here.&#34;\n\n&#34;Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\&#39;t know me.  I\&#39;m not saying Barry \ndoesn\&#39;t know me, but don\&#39;t say I\&#39;ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\&#39;m\na perfectionist.&#34;\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. &#34;But \neven though I didn\&#39;t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\&#39;s \na bit of a jump,&#34; he said.  &#34;You\&#39;re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou\&#39;re No. 1 and if you don\&#39;t you\&#39;re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\&#39;s what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn\&#39;t come through when he counted on me.  I don\&#39;t know. What I \ndo know is, it\&#39;s a sport.  I\&#39;ll be there.&#34;\n\nMelrose\&#39;s &#34;goalie of the future&#34; statement doesn\&#39;t mean much to Stauber. &#34;Before\nyou know it, I\&#39;ll be 30 and there will be no future,&#34; he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.

  &#34;Hello Hockey fans.\nBonjour tout le monde!\n\nWell, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not\nto televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!\nAnyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can\nnot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing\neverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.\n\nI am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now\nthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to\npull in\nthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am\nnot sure.\n\nIF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to\ntelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.\n\nThanks in advance\nMerci d&#39;avance\n\nP.S.

  &#39;\n\n\tOk, I\&#39;ll admit it.  I can\&#39;t find a quote with my meager online\nresources.  but i did find this little gem:\n\n\t``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in\n\tthis part of the world.  Our people will continue to fuel the torch\n\tof the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the\n\toccupied homeland is liberated...\&#39;\&#39;\n\t--- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79\n\n\tSo, Ahmed is right.

  &#39;\n\nMy, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.\n\n  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.\n  (Ps. 32:1).\n\nand quoted by the apostle Paul:\n\n  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God\n  imputeth righteousness without works,\n  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins\n  are covered.\n  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)\n\nThe biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are\nparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational\ndistinction is unwarranted.\n\n\nI\&#39;m sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You\&#39;re suggesting Jesus is\ngoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for\nmillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver\nwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting\nspeculation, though.\n\nI\&#39;ll leave comments on the so-called &#34;bema seat&#34; vs. &#34;throne&#34; judgments to\nsomeone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala\ndispensationalism.\n&#39;,

  &#34;\n\nHow do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\na pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\nunlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\nthe Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\nof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\nmaintain the team&#39;s success but can&#39;t push them to the next level.\n\nIn the history of hockey there have been several better GM&#39;s than Murray-\nway too many to name.  Murray isn&#39;t even the best GM in the league today.\nHe fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and\nQuinn in my estimation.\n\nI can&#39;t imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen\nin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM&#39;s.&#34;,

  &#34;\n\nWell yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore\ndifficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They\ncertainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this\nwas not necessarily their true position.\n\n\nThe Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.\nThe stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914\nand David Llloyd George&#39;s budget.

Until Bush abused it\nin a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent\nof being a check on unreasonable legislation.

  &#39;Archive-name: atheism/logic\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\nVersion: 1.4\n\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\n\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, &#34;It is\nraining&#34; or &#34;Today is Tuesday&#34;.  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof &#34;deny&#34;, not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So &#34;God exists&#34; and &#34;There exists a\nGod&#34; both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, &#34;a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition&#34;.  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as &#34;because&#34;,\n&#34;since&#34;, &#34;obviously&#34; and so on.  (The phrase &#34;obviously&#34; is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn\&#39;t seem obvious to you, don\&#39;t be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say &#34;Oh, yes, you\&#39;re right, it is obvious&#34; when\nyou\&#39;ve heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as &#34;implies that&#34; or\n&#34;therefore&#34;.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as &#34;therefore&#34;, &#34;it follows that&#34;, &#34;we conclude&#34;\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n&#34;If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.&#34;\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\&#39;ll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n&#34;God created you; therefore do your duty to God.&#34;\n\nThe phrase &#34;do your duty to God&#34; is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form &#34;A because\nB&#34;.  If we\&#39;re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we\&#39;re trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n&#34;There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.&#34; -- This is an argument.\n\n&#34;My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.&#34;\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\&#39;s premises are false. \nIf the argument\&#39;s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a &#34;truth table&#34; for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol &#34;=&gt;&#34; denotes implication; &#34;A&#34; is the premise, &#34;B&#34; the conclusion. \n&#34;T&#34; and &#34;F&#34; represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=&gt;B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term &#34;fallacy&#34; is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as &#34;might makes right&#34;. \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n&#34;... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.&#34;\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally &#34;argument directed at the man&#34;.\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n&#34;Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.&#34;\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\&#39;s\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent\&#39;s particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n&#34;It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you\&#39;re quite happy to wear leather shoes?&#34;\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent\&#39;s argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n&#34;Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou\&#39;re white.&#34;\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\&#39;s\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as &#34;poisoning the well&#34;.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means &#34;argument from ignorance&#34;.  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n&#34;Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.&#34;\n\n&#34;Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.&#34;\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n&#34;A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.&#34;\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n&#34;I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\&#39;t find me\nguilty; I\&#39;m suffering enough through being an orphan.&#34;\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n&#34;Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.&#34;\n\n&#34;The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?&#34;\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n&#34;Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.&#34;\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n&#34;Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation&#34;\nand\n&#34;John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer&#34;\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose &#34;accidental&#34; circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n&#34;Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.&#34;\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n&#34;Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.&#34;\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n&#34;I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.&#34;\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n&#34;The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.&#34;\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n&#34;Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.&#34;\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services\&#39; official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n&#34;We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.&#34;\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n&#34;Have you stopped beating your wife?&#34;\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n&#34;Where did you hide the money you stole?&#34;\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n&#34;How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?&#34;\nor\n&#34;Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?&#34;\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n&#34;What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.&#34;\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n&#34;We should not speak ILL of our friends&#34;\nand\n&#34;We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS&#34;\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n&#34;The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.&#34;\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n&#34;A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.&#34;\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n&#34;You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.&#34;\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n&#34;Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.&#34;\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n&#34;If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we\&#39;ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.&#34;\n\n&#34;A IS BASED ON B&#34; FALLACIES / &#34;IS A TYPE OF&#34; FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n&#34;Isn\&#39;t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\&#39;t the Bible also a form of\nhistory?&#34;\n\n&#34;Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\&#39;t Islam a\nform of Christianity?&#34;\n\n&#34;Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\&#39;t dogs a form of cat?&#34;\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form &#34;A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true&#34;.  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form &#34;A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false&#34;.  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form &#34;A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false&#34;, where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form &#34;If A then B, therefore if B then A&#34;.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because &#34;that\&#39;s the way it\&#39;s always been.&#34;\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An &#34;argumentum ad nauseum&#34; is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the &#34;black and white&#34; fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\&#39;s attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\&#39;s position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n&#34;I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.&#34;\n\n&#34;Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.&#34;\n\n&#34;Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!&#34;\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous &#34;you too&#34; fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n&#34;You\&#39;re just being randomly abusive.&#34;\n&#34;So?  You\&#39;ve been abusive too.&#34;&#39;,

  &#34;The xgolf program was an April Fool&#39;s joke &lt;sigh&gt;.&#34;,
  &#39;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice try Deepak, but &#34;tough Whaler squad&#34; should have clued you in to the\nfact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.\n\nIf playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then\nit is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times\nin 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will\nbe carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don\&#39;t really give a damn.  Of course I can\&#39;t say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon\&#39;t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n&#34;take&#34; as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with &#34;winning spirit&#34; and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and &#34;hot&#34;.  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their &#34;sudden death&#34; appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n&#39;,
  &#39;: \n: &gt;&gt; Please enlighten me.  How is omnipotence contradictory?\n: \n: &gt;By definition, all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules\n: &gt;of nature. Thus god cannot break them. Anything that god does must be allowed\n: &gt;in the rules somewhere. Therefore, omnipotence CANNOT exist! It contradicts\n: &gt;the rules of nature.\n: \n: Obviously, an omnipotent god can change the rules.\n\nWhen you say, &#34;By definition&#34;, what exactly is being defined;\ncertainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the &#34;rules of\nnature&#34; are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but\nactually cause it. If that\&#39;s what you mean I\&#39;d like to hear your\nfurther thoughts on the question.&#39;,
  &#34;\n\nAnd you know why this is? Because you&#39;ve conveniently _defined_ a theist as\nsomeone who can do no wrong, and you&#39;ve _defined_ people who do wrong as\natheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,\nas such, has no value.&#34;,
  &#39;I was wondering if anyone had any information about Molluscous contagiosem.\nI acquired it, and fortunately got rid of it, but the question still lingers\nin my mind: Where did it come from?  The little bit of info that I have \nreceived about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually, but\nalso occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia.\n\nAny information will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n&#34;I grow old, I grow old;\nI shall wear my trousers rolled.&#34;&#39;,

  &#34;\n\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \nbe believed. I have been observing that &#39;Poly&#39; has been practicing \nGoebels&#39; rule quite loyally. &#39;Poly&#39;s audience is mostly made of Greeks \nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today&#39;s \ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \nreally happened. \n\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls&#39; Lycee \nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls&#39; Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \nMen&#39;s Lycee Foundation.  \n\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective &#39;Turkish&#39; \nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers&#39; Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word &#39;Turkish&#39; on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term &#39;Turks,&#39; \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto &#39;Muslims.&#39; The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The &#39;Pomaks&#39; are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor &#39;Poly.&#39;\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the &#39;democratic&#39; Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the &#39;so-called&#39; \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to &#39;internal exile&#39; on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n &#39;Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.&#39;\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  &#39;Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,&#39; Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser &amp; Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n&lt;&lt; 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\n\n   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:\n\n  Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed\n  Bohor Levy, tailor               killed\n  Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed\n  Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed\n  David Aroguete                   killed\n  Moussa Lerosse                   killed\n  Gioia Katan                      killed\n  Meryem Malki                     killed\n  Soultan Gharib                   killed\n  Isaac Sabah                      wounded\n  Moche Fahmi                      wounded\n  David Sabah                      wounded\n  Moise Bensignor                  killed\n  Sarah Bendi                      killed\n  Jacob Jaffe                      wounded\n  Aslan Halegna                    wounded....&gt;&gt;\n\nSerdar Argic&#34;,

  &#34;  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This\nAndi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet\nbecause he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you\nattack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi&#39;s\nquestion in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only\nones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact\nare the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some\nINTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!\n{assuming you are also semitic}\n\tNow I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism\nduring the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s.  The Hirgun, and other branch -\noff militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of\nPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I&#39;m anti semitic [I&#39;m part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.  I&#39;m not as critical of the\nPalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the\nJews.  It &#39;s a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for\nGerman and European anti semitism.&#34;,

  &#39;\nThere certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of \na global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, \nhowever, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the \nformer) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. \nI  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing \n&#34;Islamicization&#34; through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same\napproach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side\&#39;s\npower are certainly a threat.\n\nTo Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance\nof those *outside* its own &#34;group&#34;. If I am told that &#34;I am not one of\nyou&#34; but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.\nIf I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic\nworld and *actively did not* accept my &#34;minority&#34; status, I *would also \ncertainly* see Islam\&#39;s domination as having been acheived, and maintained, \nthrough the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities\nwithin their ranks.\n\nI am not a zionist, but do feel that *both* Jewish and Palestinian\nnationalist desires need, at this juncture, to be accepted in some way.\nFor the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous\nfor Islam to be spread by force upon those who DO NOT WANT THAT. \n\n\n[I refer to the &#34;most&#34; you also refer to] \nBecause they are scared, and feel very threatened, as well feeling that \nthis area *is* to some degree part of their belief/religion/heritage/\nidentity/etc.&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nHow could this possibly be &#34;environmental vandalism&#34; when there is no\n&#34;environment&#34; to vandalize up there?\n\nSince the advertising &#34;is just to help defray costs&#34;, it\&#39;s certainly no\nsurprise that &#34;the taxpayers would bear most of the expense&#34;.  Sounds\nlike a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the\nexpense if they didn\&#39;t do the advertising.\n\n\nGreat idea, they should have done it long ago.\n\n\nI can\&#39;t believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant\neffect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,\nbut nobody complains about that.  Besides, it\&#39;s in LEO, so it would only\nbe visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if\nit would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time\nas it goes zipping across the sky.\n\n\nNo doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so\nit would be no surprise.\n\n\nWell, look on the, er, bright side.  Imagine the looks on the faces of\npeople in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up\nand see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky... :-D\n\n--&#39;,

  &#39;\n\n    What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I\nsing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that,\nthen you will have to get over it. I\&#39;ve used this account name for over\n10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7\ngenerally recognize &#34;Hades&#34; as my account name. I have no intention of\nchanging the way I post.\n\n\n    It isn\&#39;t Apple\&#39;s responsibility to tell its customers how to fool\naround with it\&#39;s hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to\ndo. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for\ncoming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of\nthose drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except\nfor those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you\nabout the LW Pro design.\n\n\n    Again, its\&#39;s not Apple\&#39;s place to make it easy for non-certified\nservice people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy\nit. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don\&#39;t\nget upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no\nlonger valid.\n\n\n    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB\nSIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily\navailable. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and\nmake it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just\nfine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are\ngenerally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.&#39;,
  &#34;Perusing through my Windows 3.1 directory, I came across a file\ncalled REGLOAD.EXE.

  &#39;[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\n\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\n\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n&#34;election fraud&#34; to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\&#39;t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon\&#39;s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\&#39;s\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives\&#39; staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, &#34;Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.&#34;  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n&#34;I\&#39;m not from the gun lobby -- I\&#39;m from your district.&#34;\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren\&#39;t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon\&#39;s Rock anti-gun &#34;close-the-loophole&#34; protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto &#34;support GOAL\&#39;s position&#34; on &#34;all bills.&#34;\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\&#39;s Rock\nfolks called the current law a &#34;loophole&#34; and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his &#34;SKS assault rifle.&#34;\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\&#39;s home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state &#34;as strong as&#34;\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\&#39;s that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  &#34;In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\&#39;s breathing!&#34;\n(Oooooo!)  &#34;We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\&#39;t\nbe having this situation -- but they won\&#39;t.&#34;  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert &#34;Dapper&#34; O\&#39;Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\&#39;s\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\&#39;s\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he\&#39;d give arrestees their &#34;last rights&#34; (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n&#34;I\&#39;m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.&#34;  I haven\&#39;t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\&#39;t a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n&#34;Revenue has nothing to do with it.&#34;  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we\&#39;re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit\&#39;s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn\&#39;t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both &#34;restraining\norder&#34; bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\&#39;t let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the &#34;restraining order&#34; bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, &#34;every\nyear it\&#39;s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...&#34;\nIt\&#39;s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\&#39;t continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the &#34;public&#34;\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: &#34;If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.&#34;  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several &#34;battered women,&#34; one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\&#39;s who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that &#34;this is America&#34; and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that &#34;people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.&#34;  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\&#39;t know his\ncitizenship &#34;expired every 5 years,&#34; and that a driver\&#39;s license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, &#34;I\&#39;ll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I\&#39;ll tie the noose.&#34;\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\&#39;s Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that &#34;he\nwouldn\&#39;t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside&#34; without his evil gun.  She said that the &#34;loophole&#34; should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from &#34;ever happening again&#34;.\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, &#34;As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.&#34;  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  &#34;Only residents can get\nFID\&#39;s,&#34; he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was &#34;elitist&#34;.  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad &#34;FID-type&#34; cards, so complying with all the laws of one\&#39;s home\nstate was &#34;not enough.&#34;  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n&#34;Everyone\&#39;s out of step but Johnny!&#34;\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL\&#39;s position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state\&#39;s archaic records capability and said,\n&#34;This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.&#34;\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- &#39;,

  &#34;There is a new product for the (IBM&#39;ers) out there... it is called\nIMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPUlSE, and is in its\n3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections &amp; shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...\n\nyou can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...\nalso animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)\nalso animted reflections maps....\n\nyou get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...\n\ndont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it\ncomes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!\n\nalso....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list??\nplease e-mail me if you do or post up here....\n\noh...the number for IMPULSE is ---&gt;1 800 328 0184&#34;,

  &#34;I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here \nalso have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend \nextra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 \nMHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the \n3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate \nappears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of \nspending money, with the size of today&#39;s files, etc, a tape backup is \ncertainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend&#39;s PC 50Mhz and VESA \nlocal bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 \nfaster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.\n&#34;,
  &#34;I&#39;ve seen several references to split- or separate-beam radars, which I\nclaimed didn&#39;t exist.  Gotta eat some crow here - I wasn&#39;t aware of them.\nAll I really knew was that it can be done with one beam.\n\nI believe the rest of what I said is accurate, though.&#34;,
  &#39;Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\nMoody Bible Institute:\n\n\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\nexactly what the criticism of &#34;arrogance&#34; is aimed at.\n\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we &#34;think we are the only ones who know\nwhat the absolutes are&#34;.  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as &#34;how do you know?&#34;  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\&#39; is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet\&#39;s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered &#34;absolutely certain&#34;.\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\&#39;s go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: &#34;how do you know?&#34;  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\&#39;t mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say &#34;I\ncan\&#39;t prove that there are no mistakes&#34; -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the &#34;arrogance of Christians&#34; arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nNote that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire\nlasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The\nmain reason for it\&#39;s fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by\nthe men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been\nexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city\nof Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of\nMazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter\nof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto\nthe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle\nshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of\nConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks\nhad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the\nCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd\nCrusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they\nconsidered heretics, even though those &#34;heretics&#34; were fighting for the\ncause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish\nhordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some\nhordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of\nEurope (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)&#39;,
  &#39;IM pleased to announce a new revolutionary device that allows you to\ncopy super nintendo and genesis games to floppy disk.  Then later\nplay from floppy disk with out the cart.  This is a independent system\nthat interfaces with your SNES or Genesis.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n\n*Store multiple copies of cart. save game to disk (up to 32 saves to disk)\n\n*Save your position in SNES games that don\&#39;t norally have a save feature\n\n*Switch your SNES into slow motion mode\n\n*Use codes to get unlimited lives and other &#34;cheats&#34; in many games.\n\nThe Multi-Game Hunter is capable of copying both SNES and Genesis game \ncarts to standard IBM PC formated floppy disks. The games can them be played directly from the floppy disk. NOTE:IT does not require a PC\n\nFull color on-screen icons and menus make operation for the MGH so simple\nthat even a child could operate it.  Options can be selected simply by choosing the selection with the game controller and pressin a button.\n\nAdd a Game saver adapter to your system for more game playing power.  The\nGame saver allows you to save your position to disk in almost any SNES game!\nReload your saved position any time.  Enable it\&#39;s slow-motion feature for those really tough games.\n\nFor more control over game play, We have the Game finger software.

Neither Nintendo or Sega has giving official endorsement of the \nproducts described herein.&#39;,
  &#39;\nOn the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80\&#39;s the &#34;electronic&#34;\nodometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven\nby pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are \nconverted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.\nNo way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage\nreading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to\nchange as any other mechanical odometer.\n\nOn the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor\nand run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple\nswitch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,\nwhich will enable the car to reach it\&#39;s full speed.  ;-)\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nWhile others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the\nsentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,\nit is only &#34;relatively&#34; recent that the Windows drivers for this card\nhave evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are\nSTILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,\nmis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.\nIf there\&#39;s a more recent release, I\&#39;d appreciate if someone would\ndrop me a note to let me know -- I haven\&#39;t been able to get on their\nBBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn\&#39;t even bother\nnotifying me of fixes/releases.\n\nDiamond was helpful when I finally reached the &#34;right&#34; person in curing\nsome of my Windows\&#39; problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting\naddresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the\nDiamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep\nexplained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not\nconfirmed the validity of that statement.\n\nWhen I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some\nform of local bus), I\&#39;ll seek a video solution from someone other than\nDiamond.\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a \&#39;%\&#39; (percent sign) in my network address.&#39;,
  &#39;\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become &#34;negative&#34;, or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nNo matter how &#34;absurd&#34; it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:&#39;,
  &#34;I&#39;ve recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I&#39;d like to do some\nC programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me\naccess the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C?&#34;,
  &#39;Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\n\nSeveral problems:\n\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\n   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\n   VRAM.\n\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\n      be.\n\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\n\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\n\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\n   &#34;R&#34;. This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn\&#39;t have to do this.\n\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\n   the VGA mode.\n   \n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\n\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).\n&#39;,

  &#39;From the article &#34;What\&#39;s New&#34; Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:\n\n........\nWHAT\&#39;S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC\n\n1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE &#34;SPINOFFS&#34; WE WERE PROMISED?\nIn 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published &#34;The\nMan Who Sold the Moon,&#34; which involved a dispute over the sale of\nrights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this\n hideous vision of the future.  Observers were\nstartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the\npad with &#34;SCHWARZENEGGER&#34; painted in huge block letters on the\nside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged\nfor the ad to promote Arnold\&#39;s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing\nis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on\na plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth\norbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,\nsince NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates\n(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This\nmay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of\nSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\nproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone\nmonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.\n..........\n\nWhat do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\nthe night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.\nWhat about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that\nit might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).\nIs NASA really supporting this junk?\nAre protesting groups being organized in the States?\nReally, really depressed.\n\n             Enzo&#39;,
  &#39;\nOK...\n\n5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was\n   left.  Like, &#34;can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should\n   I get gouged right here at $1.35?&#34;  Accurate to the tenth of a\n   gallon would be great.&#39;,
  &#39;\nSince the digital transmission schemes include error correction and\nconcealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low\ncarrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,\ndigitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference\nthan amplitude modulated TV.\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nWhy retract your accusation that he\&#39;s a liar?  If Omran retracts his &#34;verbal\ndiarrohea&#34; doesn\&#39;t that only prove the liar he *really* is?  A retraction\nwould be pointless!  Giving this guy the opportunity to &#34;save face&#34; after\nuttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  I must say\nthat your style is very impressive, Mark.  Keep it up!\n\n- Mike\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\tOne of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is\ntheir belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity.

It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. \n\tFortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not\nfall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both\nwithout gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both\na masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find\nsorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible\nfor a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat\neach other.&#39;,

  &#39;Archive-name: space/astronaut\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $\n\nHOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT\n\n    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA\n    announcement.\n\n    Q. How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\&#39;s probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\&#39;re better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle &#34;mission\n    specialist&#34;.\n\n    If you aren\&#39;t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\&#39;s problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can\&#39;t, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you\&#39;ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\&#39;s image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot\&#39;s license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant &#34;you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first&#34;.\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\&#39;t make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle\&#39;s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1.

Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master\&#39;s\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor\&#39;s degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\&#39;s\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n&#39;,

  &#34;G&#39;day people,\n\t\n\tAre there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why\nmy MR2&#39;s engine sounds noisy? The MR2&#39;s engine is noisy at the best of times, \nbut not even a nice nose - it&#39;s one of those very ugly noises. \n\tI do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine\nnoise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month\nmark, after an oil change (I&#39;ve been tracking this very thoroughly for months\nnow) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,\nbut more so during idling. \n\tWhat&#39;s its problem? \n\tAlso.. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but if noticed a little\nperformance drop. It just hasn&#39;t got the acceleration it used to. \n\n\tAny help/tips would be appreciated!!\n&#34;,

  &#34;Hello,\n  I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don&#39;t know if \nthere is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the \nRAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead \nSIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on \nthe screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance&#34;,
  &#39;\nPlease forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow\nthe argument.\n\nMy point is that &#34;if life has meaning or importance then we should try\nto find that meaning or importance&#34; which is almost a tautology. (I hope\nI\&#39;m not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is &#34;Creator&#34;,\nthough that is not obvious from my above argument.\n\n\n(It\&#39;s more like &#34;I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.&#34;)\n\n\nUnfortunately the term &#34;religious&#34; is ambiguous to me in this context.\nI could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being\nreligious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on \nthe search.\n\nIf you want &#34;meaning&#34; why not search for the truth?\n\nSo far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding\nof truth. There have been many before me who have come to conclusions \nthat are worded in ways that make sense to me. By no means does that imply\nthat I understand everything. &#39;,
  &#39;Toronto Siggraph \n================\n\nWhat: ``Chance\&#39;s Art\&#39;\&#39;: 2D Graphics and Animation on the Indigo.\n\nBy:    Ken Evans, Imagicians Artware, Inc. \n\nWhen:  Tuesday 20 April 1993 7:00pm-9:00pm \n\nWhere: The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology\n       University of Toronto\n       39A Queen\&#39;s Park Crescent\n       Toronto\n\nWho:   Members and non-members alike \n       (non-members encouraged to become members...)\n\nAbstract:\n\nImagicians Artware, Inc. is entering into early beta site testing on Silicon \nGraphics workstations of a new 2D abstract artwork and animation package called \nChance\&#39;s Art.  The package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the \ntechnical issues will be discussed.  Marketing plans will be outlined.  The \ntalk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly \nconfronting small startup software companies today, and some of the \nopportunities this situation presents.\n\nTime after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to \ninterested parties.  Silicon Graphics is graciously providing an Indigo for \nthis event.  Myck Kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive \nreflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the McLuhan Centre, so \nfeel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. BTW, be \nsure to sing &#34;Happy Birthday, Myck&#34;...\n\nThe names of nominees for our Siggraph executive offices will be announced at \nthis meeting.  Nominations will still be open until the election at our \nMay 18th event; call Myck Kupka at 465-0943 or fax to 465-0729.  \n\nDirections: The McLuhan Coachhouse is on the east side of Queen\&#39;s Park \nCrescent, just NORTH of Wellesley, SOUTH of St. Joseph St., BEHIND (EAST of) \n39 Queen\&#39;s Park Crescent, which is the centre for Mediaeval Studies.  &#39;,

  &#34;\n\n\n\n       Well, I don&#39;t think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to\ngive you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.\n\n       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many\nof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      \nis commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about\nthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that\nMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this\nascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a \ndescriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have\nused it in the past.\n\n\n      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don&#39;t feel compelled to\ndiscuss Mr. King&#39;s racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \n\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\nme using the adjective &#39;black&#39; in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have\nbeen happier if I had used &#39;African-american&#39; ?  If so, then you really are\nlost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one\npersons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my \nmessage to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.&#34;,
  &#39;The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read\non...\n\nI am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,\ndisplays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The\nproblem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems\nincluding (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):\n\n- Core Dump\n- BadPixmap X Error\n- Widget not unmapped\n\n\nHere is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:\n\n#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Xm/PushB.h&gt;\n\nvoid bla()\n{\n        XtAppContext app;\n        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay(&#34;&#34;);\n        int junk = 0;\n\n        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&amp;app, &#34;test&#34;, NULL, 0, &amp;junk, NULL,\n                NULL, NULL, 0);\n\n        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(&#34;blaaa&#34;, xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n                        top,\n                        XmNheight, 50,\n                        XmNwidth, 50,\n                        NULL);\n\n        XtRealizeWidget(top);\n        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents\n        for (int i=0;i&lt;=10;i++)\n        {\n                XEvent event;\n                XtAppNextEvent(app, &amp;event);\n                XtDispatchEvent(&amp;event);\n        }\n\n// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???\n        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);\n        XtDestroyWidget(top);\n        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);\n        XCloseDisplay(dis);\n// ???\n}\n\nmain()\n{\n        for (int i=0;i&lt;=20;i++)\n                bla();\n}\n\nNote that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,\nafter 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.\nWith this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)\nthe 5th call to bla():\n\nX Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)\n  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d\n  Serial number of failed request:  71\n  Current serial number in output stream:  86\n\nIf I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the\nseconds call.\n\nFurthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I\nget:\n\nWarning: Initializing Resource Lists twice\nWarning: Initializing Translation manager twice.\n\n\nSo finally, my question is this:\n\nWhat needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates\nan XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n-davewood\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder&#39;,
  &#39;\nYes. As long as the goverment over there can force some authority and prevent\nterrorists attack against Israel. \n\n\nSinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to\nEgypth, but for a peace agreement. So it is my opinin that the settlers will not\nbe an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement\nwith the Arabs and the Palastinians.\n\n\n\nNaftaly\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n: &gt;True, man did not invent the need for food, shelter, warmth and the ilk,\n: &gt;but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass.   \n: But how do you think property is generated ? Does it grow automatically\n: on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?\n\nSome say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of\nthe coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,\nthe property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.\n\n\n:     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not\n: provide us automatically with our needs,\n\nOh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing\nus with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It\nis not &#34;produced&#34;: it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for\nexample, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an\nearlier time, one of them would have been dinner.\n\n: There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to \n: _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it. \n: The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced\n: it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages\n: arrange their affairs.\n\nThe American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often\nfreely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and\nclothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their\nPolynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared\nmany things with the other Islanders.  In fact, &#34;hi\&#39;ipoi&#34;, the Hawaiian\nword for &#34;cherish&#34; means &#34;sharing food&#34;.  The Great Mahele, in which\nthe Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and\nthe poor, was a white man\&#39;s idea.  In Africa, villagers will often\nshare tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village\nand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to\nAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-\ncalled &#34;theft&#34; of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,\nuntil the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.\n\nThese are the people we call &#34;savages&#34;.\n\nOn the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.\n\nDov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would\nbehoove you to study *all* of the facts.\n&#39;,
  &#34;\nI believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump\nthe liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.\nSo if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on \nhold, or else!! That&#39;s about it. Remember a liquid is several more times\nas dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think, depending on the gas\nand liquid comparision of course!&#34;,

  &#34;\n\nI hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify\nsome things so I won&#39;t get flamed.\n\nFirst of all, when I&#39;m talking about ``factoring the modulus&#39;&#39; or a\n``breakthrough in factoring&#39;&#39;, what I really mean is a breakthrough in\nthe cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are\nnot proven to be equivalent; it&#39;s just so damn convenient not to\nrepeat this every time.\n\nI also have to admit that I don&#39;t really know if the ``non-group&#39;&#39;\nproperty of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have\nthought about it a little while, but I can&#39;t find a way that a\ncryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means\nnothing at all.\n\nThen I wrote,\n\n\nWhat I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the\ncryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for\na long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be\nbroken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people\nwould simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit\nfrom better technology in the same way.\n\nHope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.\n&#34;,
  &#39;\nWould if only it were true ...\n\nIf only MIT would fix the !@&amp;$^*@ twm &#34;InstallWindowColormaps()&#34; crash bug\nonce and for all, then I could say that I\&#39;ve (almost) unable to crash either\n&#34;twm&#34; or &#34;tvtwm&#34;, which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to\nboot.  I mean, this bug has only been reported, oh, a zillion times by now ...\n\nNow *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0 &#34;xnews&#34;\nserver at will?

  &#34;\n\nI believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset\nis limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where &#39;real&#39; EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The\nHINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this\nreason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-\ning to replace it for exactly this reason.\n\nPlease double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard\nmanufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA\nDMA.\n\nOther than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using\nmine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a\nEISA SCSI host adapter.\n&#34;,

Using bombers and artillery\nagainst Lebanese towns and villages. Using fire arms and lethal\nvariants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone\nthrowers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5\nminute evacuation warning.  Using Shin Bit\&#39;s &#34;reasonable&#34; physical\npressure in interrogation. And more. Not counting of course past \npractices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982, the bombing of the \nEgyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za\&#39;bal factory in 1978,\nthe downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near\nthe same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla.\nThat is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs\nduring the British mandate period.\n\nIronically the same Op-Ed page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly\ncopied this article was running another article next to it by A.M.\nRosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively\nsaying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring\nyour people slaughter.

  &#39;\nYes, it\&#39;s important to realize that all actions have consequences,\nand that &#34;rules&#34; were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\n\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \nsin.  The Jews of Jesus\&#39;s time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment&#34; for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\&#39;ve missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn\&#39;t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I\&#39;ve said this before, but I think\nit\&#39;s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\&#39;t what I would want it to be,\nbut God\&#39;s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she\&#39;s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God\&#39;s intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God\&#39;s grace.\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt\t\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research\tPhone:\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\n  Laboratories\t\tFedex:\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas\tPostal:\t  P.O.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\&#39;s in Azerbaijan, near the\nNagorno Karabagh region.\n\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said &#34;uprising&#34; in\nAzerbaijani, but I don\&#39;t think it was really an uprising, just a \ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \nwouldn\&#39;t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \nbad. I didn\&#39;t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\n&#34;There\&#39;s unrest everywhere, be careful.&#34; Well I had a project going on. I told\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\&#39;t allow it, they \nsaid, &#34;Nothing\&#39;s going to happen to you, we\&#39;ve entrusted the matter to the \npolice, we\&#39;ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.&#34; \nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\nman didn\&#39;t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\n\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, &#34;The situation is\nvery tense, be careful.&#34;\n\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\nshouldn\&#39;t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\&#39;s\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\n\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \nbuses aren\&#39;t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, &#34;Let\&#39;s go find some other way to get\nthere.&#34; They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\ntake us to Sumgait.\n\nHe took us there. But the others had said, &#34;I wouldn\&#39;t go if you gave me a\nthousand rubles.&#34; &#34;Why?&#34; &#34;Because they\&#39;re burning the city and killing the\nArmenians. There isn\&#39;t an Armenian left.&#34; Well I got hold of myself so I could\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, &#34;In fact there aren\&#39;t any\nArmenians left. \&#39;They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.&#34; Well \nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \n&#34;How old are you, old man?&#34; He wants to know: if I\&#39;m being that quiet, not \nsaying anything, maybe it means I\&#39;m an Armenian. &#34;How old are you?&#34; he asks \nme. I say, &#34;I\&#39;m 47.&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m 47 too, but I call you \&#39;old man\&#39;.&#34; I say, &#34;It \ndepends on God, each person\&#39;s life in this world is different.&#34; I look much\nolder than my years, that\&#39;s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\nsilent, too.\n\nWe\&#39;re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\&#39;m sitting there with\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\nthere were no Armenians with us.\n\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \nstreet, you know, and there\&#39;s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\n\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\&#39;s an Armenian and who\&#39;s \nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\&#39;m an Armenian, but I speak \ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \n&#34;nut,&#34; or &#34;little nut,&#34; as &#34;pundukh,&#34; but &#34;fundukh&#34; is actually correct. The \npronunciations are different. Anyone who says &#34;pundukh,&#34; even if they\&#39;re not \nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \n&#34;There was a car there, with five people inside it,&#34; he says. &#34;They started \nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\&#39;t let the\npeople out,&#34; he says, &#34;they wouldn\&#39;t let them get out of the car.&#34; I only saw \nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\n\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\&#39;s a short guy,\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. &#34;We\&#39;re\nAzerbaijani,\&#39; they tell him, \&#39;no Armenians here.&#34; He did come up to me when \nwe were pulling our things out and says, &#34;Maybe you\&#39;re an Armenian, old man?&#34; \nBut in Azerbaijani I say, &#34;You should be ashamed of yourself!&#34; And . . . he \nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \nhome.\n\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\&#39;s where the Kavkaz store \nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\&#39;s the beginning of down-town. I \nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \ncouldn\&#39;t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\n\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\&#39;s true, but pistol shots.\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \noff Sumgait.\n\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \ntheir gait that they\&#39;re not bandits, they\&#39;re just people, walking home. I\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\&#39;m a local and might be quickly \nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\nI can\&#39;t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \nbehind him. And he\&#39;s shouting into a megaphone: &#34;Comrades, the Armenian-\nAzerbaijani war has begun!&#34;\n\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\&#39;re talking and walking around \nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\&#39;re coming my way, and turn off \nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \ndoing I can\&#39;t say, because I couldn\&#39;t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\n\n   April 20, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

  &#39;\nAs a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the\n&#34;innovations&#34; of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return\nto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.\n\nI spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in\nthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the &#34;Tenebrae&#34; service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those &#34;facts&#34; were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee\&#39;s suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA &#34;wishy-washy&#34;.\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don\&#39;t want \nthem attending a show.  It\&#39;s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and &#34;fit in&#34;.\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\n\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn\&#39;t listen.  They are there to \nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\nministers.\n\nIn Christ,\nKershner\n-- \nKershner Wyatt\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com&#39;,

  &#34;\n\nI agree, I reckon it&#39;s television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You\nthink its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because\npsychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent\ncriminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think\nit&#39;s the increase in designer drugs... others think it&#39;s a communist plot.\nBasically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society\nare far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the\npanic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one\nthings for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not\ndue solely to sex out of marriage.\n\nJeff.\n&#34;,

  &#34;\n\nWhat I&#39;ve been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior.\nThat is, it doesn&#39;t take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to\nbe immoral (in some cases).  Also, I&#39;ve said that morality is a remnant\nof evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in\nthe animal kingdom.\n\n\nBut, this doesn&#39;t get us anywhere.

  &#34;\n\nNot too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in &#39;78. :-) It was\n3rd place in the &#39;78 speed wars (behind the CBX &amp; XS Eleven) with a\n11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn&#39;t even make a good 600\nthese days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn&#39;t the\nonly thing that&#39;s changed. Of course I&#39;d still rather ride the old GS\nacross three states than any of the 600&#39;s.\n\nI guess it&#39;s an indication of how much things have changed that a 12\nsecond 400 didn&#39;t seem too far out of line.&#34;,

  &#34;\nSorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes\nwith Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.\nSo at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don&#39;t\nthink that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is\nnot very nice.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nArno\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArno Schaefer\t\t\t\tENSIMAG, 2e Annee\nEmail: schaefer@silene.imag.fr\nTel.: (33) 76 51 79 95\t\t\t:-)&#34;,

  &#34;\nI&#39;d be willing to make two wagers:\n1) Snow doesn&#39;t win ROY.\n2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.\n\nI&#39;m skeptical of the first, because I don&#39;t think Snow is that good a\nplayer, and he is on a losing team.\n\nI&#39;m skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this\nyear, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and\nmost of them didn&#39;t have chronic back problems when they were 32.\n\nCould be wrong on either or both, but I think that&#39;s the smart way to\nbet...&#34;,
  &#39;I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They\nwere talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately\nafter the defense attorney asked the question, there was an &#34;Objection!&#34; heard\nin the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don\&#39;t know if the\nobjection was upheld.  I can\&#39;t imagine NC is *that* bad. \n\nThis I didn\&#39;t hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on\nnews stories both during and after the trial.  Now the &#34;we did it on purpose&#34;\nthing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If\nsomebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to\nclarify.  \n        \nFrank\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrank R.

  &#34;/(me)\n\n/(hudson)\n/Why does that make something immoral?\n\n\n\nBecause you are not being consistent.

  &#39;\n\n   &#34;A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their\nright to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of\nHandgun Control, Inc.  This action comes as local, state and federal law\nenforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian\ncompound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one\ntwo year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlighted\nthe need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children\nagainst the excesses of their own government.&#34;\n\n\n  &#34;Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a \ndistortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officials\nin central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in\nthe level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program is\na rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an\nunarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter \nrestrictions.&#34;\n\n\n   &#34;The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large\nwho are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their\nlawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average \ncitizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our\nown police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have\nshown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the\nfront lines, and the families of those who have fallen.&#34;\n\n\n   &#34;I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs\nof their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments\nfrom ideological fanatics.&#34;\n\nAin\&#39;t propaganda fun?\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nIt also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn\&#39;t mean\nthe ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to \n&#34;win the hearts and minds&#34; in favor of access to cryptography. \n\nIt\&#39;s precisely slogans like &#34;cryptography makes censorship impossible&#34;\nwhich stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor\nof encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it\nwould be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better\nprepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople\nand politicians can sympathize with.

  &#39;A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once\nthe evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.\n\nUnfortunately there is still a &#34;ghost&#34; of SPSS left: when I run\nsomething like &#34;Write&#34; and go to embed an object then &#34;SPSS Chart&#34;\nappears on the list of objects I\&#39;m offered. I looked around all\nthe obvious &#34;INI&#34; files without success. The next thing I tried\nwas looking for the string &#34;SPSS Chart&#34; in every file in the \nWindows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or\nREG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn\&#39;t feel\ninclined to edit it.\n\nI\&#39;d welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.&#39;,

  &#39;Hi,\n    I was reading through &#34;The Spaceflight Handbook&#34; and somewhere in\nthere the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them\nwhen and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to\nthe sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very\nlong-winded but here\&#39;s my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in\nfact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of\ncourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?\nCan this be extended to larger accelerations?&#39;,

  &#39;\nI agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question &#34;What temperature\ndoes water boil at?&#34;  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told &#34;It\&#39;s just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat\&#39;s what all thermometers say.&#34;  Well, that\&#39;s sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI\&#39;ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse &#34;blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks&#34; literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n\nI can\&#39;t prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God\&#39;s revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can\&#39;t comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don\&#39;t need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God\&#39;s creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It\&#39;s like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn\&#39;t affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I\&#39;m NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That\&#39;d be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.\n       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few \n       adults respond to this treatment.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n-- &#39;,
  &#34;\n\n[...stiff deleted...]\n\n\n[...stiff deleted...]\n\nSpeed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that\nwill result in the same value measured no matter the reference.

  &#39;\n  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS\nthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn\&#39;t have the initial power\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of &#34;slip&#34; device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn\&#39;t save the gears!\n\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\ndo a &#34;stoppy&#34;(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don\&#39;t recommend these\nactivities anymore (now that I\&#39;m an &#34;old guy&#34; with kids of my own) but\nit looked damn impressive!!\n\n  If you can\&#39;t keep both tires on the ground, at least have \&#39;em pointed\nin that direction! :-)&#39;,

  &#34;\nThere is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or\nGlxDraw (athena) widget.

  &#34;\nThere&#39;s absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time \n_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another \ndifference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I&#39;ve often used \nmemory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.

  &#39;\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples\&#39; question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist\&#39;s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   &#34;If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.&#34;\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (&#34;If\nyou care to accept it&#34;).  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used &#34;repeated earth lives&#34; to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word &#34;reincarnation&#34;.\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\&#39;s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\&#39;s &#34;The\nEducation of the Human Race&#34;.\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul\&#39;s statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.&#39;,

But what does that have to do with Jesus?\nPunishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment. \n\n\nGood.  I wouldn\&#39;t either--not the way you understand it.  \n\n\nAsk Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn\&#39;t a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus\&#39;s own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would &#34;stop doubting and believe&#34; (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That\&#39;s no mystery either.  &#34;The\nworld hates him without reason.&#34;  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.&#39;,

So, what do you think is the &#34;meaning behind&#34;, \n\tthe intention and the effect when an &#34;army&#34; purposely \n\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n\tlike civilians\&#39;? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n\treceive from this &#34;cover&#34; is more important that the harm\n\tthat will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin &#34;the middle&#34; of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\&#39;t *they* putting themselves\n\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves &#34;why set \n\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel\&#39;s bombing\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n&#34;taking the fight *to* the enemy&#34; will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades &#34;sitting passively&#34;\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\&#39;t work very well.\nThe &#34;host&#34; Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n\nThis is just another &#34;selectively applied&#34; statement.\n \nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe &#34;interim&#34; period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define &#34;autonomy&#34; already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will &#34;follow through&#34; the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel\&#39;s view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\&#39; words?\nSince they don\&#39;t, they are VERY reluctant to give up &#34;tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for &#34;words&#34;. For this reason,\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of &#34;guarantees&#34; they will have \nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\n\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\nIsraelis &#34;word&#34; in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this &#34;land&#34;, what the &#34;other party&#34; does\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\n\n\nWhile the &#34;major armaments&#34; (those allowing people to wage &#34;civil wars&#34;)\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and &#34;commando&#34;\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\n\n\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\nwere commonplace.\n\n\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively &#34;disarmed&#34; UNLESS the state\nis as authoritarian is Syria\&#39;s. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\nmirroring Israel\&#39;s border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\n\nThat\&#39;s what I said, ok? But, doesn\&#39;t that mean that Syria has to &#34;take over&#34;\nLebanon? I don\&#39;t think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\nWhat both &#34;sides&#34; need is to receive something &#34;tangible&#34;. The Arabs/\nPalestinians are looking for &#34;land&#34; and demanding that they receive it\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\nsituation (and that change doesn\&#39;t help Israel\&#39;s position), and 2) WHEN\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\ncompensate for the increased risks&#39;,

  &#34;\n\n\nMy 6 year son is so plagued.  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems \nto keep it under control.  But let him get bopped there, and he&#39;ll recur for \ndays!

  &#39;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSure. Yes, I did. You see I don\&#39;t think that rape and murder should\nbe dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for\nleniency\&#39;s sake, apparently think that people should simply be\ntold the &#34;did a _bad_ thing.&#34;\n\n\n\nMisjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.\nI suspect that it\&#39;s pretty unlikely that, given my requirement\nof repeated offenses, that misjudgments are very likely.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally? Care to give chapter and verse? We could discuss it.\n\n\n \n\nAgain, not all of the Orient follows the Qur\&#39;an. So you\&#39;ll have to do\nbetter than that.\n\n\nSorry, you haven\&#39;t &#34;put out&#34; enough.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis is an argument for why _you_ don\&#39;t like religions that suppress\nsex. A such it\&#39;s an irrelevant argument.\n\nIf you\&#39;d like to generalize it to an objective statement then \nfine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement\nthat sex is not the business of religion (one of your &#34;arguments&#34;).\n\nThe urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong\nmeasures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so\nstrong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to\nfind a marriage partner.\n\n&#39;,

  &#39;I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn\&#39;t pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn\&#39;t see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn\&#39;t care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\n\n&#34;A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\&#39;s Real name)  she didn\&#39;t raise\nDavid Koresh.&#34;\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere\&#39;s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the &#34;Justification&#34; part\npart of the plan.  That\&#39;s when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered &#34;Cruel and Unusal Punishment&#34; to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\&#39;s acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n&#34;And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.&#34;\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;\n\t.\n\t.\n\t.\n\nWhy do you assume that Jesus\&#39;s plea to His Father &#34;to let this cup\npass from Him&#34;, was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus\&#39;s attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus\&#39;s suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John\&#39;s account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.  From John:\n\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\n            began to say, &#34;Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\n            world.&#34;\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\n\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &amp;\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus\&#39;s\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\nwhat His Father\&#39;s will was and followed it obediently even in the\ndarkness of His Passion.\n&#39;,

  &#39;\nI don\&#39;t want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other\npostings &#34;near UV light&#34; /is/ &#34;actual UV light.&#34;  The &#34;near&#34; means that\nit is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),\nnot that it is &#34;nearly UV.&#34;  (I\&#39;m sure you can figure out now just what\n&#34;far UV&#34; is.)\n\nRegular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the\nnear end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the\nvisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are\ngoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as\nfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV\nsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The\nshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.\n\nIt wouldn\&#39;t project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes\nin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively\ncheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to\nbe useful, but not dangerously so.&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nWell, I\&#39;ve said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is\nobjectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\n\n\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\nof innocents.\n\n\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\n\n\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\n\n\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\nall such &#34;murders&#34; are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\n\n\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people\&#39;s definitions of murder\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\nexecution, is it?\n\n\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\ninnocent victim is.\n\n\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\n\n\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\nconviction was unfair.\n\n\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\npossible information), we can\&#39;t always determine the difference in our\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\nbut it still isn\&#39;t objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn\&#39;t matter if\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\n\n\nBut what we know has no effect on an objective system.\n\n\nWhy are you so sure?\n\n\nWhy is *your* reality important?\n\n\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\ntotally ideal and objective system.\n\n\nWell, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.\nWe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to\nthe ideal system as possible.\n\n\nYes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.\n\n\nWe must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep\nseparating the justice system from the pack?\n\n\nI don\&#39;t think our country has an objective system, but I think such an\nobjective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective\nsystem is not possible in practice.&#39;,
  &#39;\nThat sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.\n\n  &#34;Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the\n  door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment.&#34;\n\nPerhaps that worked in California in the 60\&#39;s, but as I understand the\nlaw landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space\nrented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc.\n(I\&#39;m not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search\nwarrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).\n\nAt this point the question becomes: did the user &#34;rent&#34; the disk space\nher encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same\nbody of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As\nto whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e.,\nno compensation exchanged), I don\&#39;t know how it would be treated -- there\ndoesn\&#39;t seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.\n&#39;,
  &#34;\n\nI sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must \nbe righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of \nUrartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to \nthe world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.\n\nAll reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of \nEastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the \nOttoman Empire between 1914-1920.\n\nIt is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators\nof the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi\nmembers of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate\nracism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. \n\nAnd x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following \nways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the \nveracity of the Turkish Genocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people&#39;s vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist\nand revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle \nof those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,\nthe international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and \nconsequently a number of governments and organizations have become \nsupportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.\n\nSerdar Argic&#34;,
  &#34;\nSo its an automatic? Don&#39;t know if US spec=CDN spec. for Maximas.\n\n\nIf it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car\neats a set every 15k miles or so.

Check\nthe maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve\nadjustments, timing belt changes and so on.\n\nThe 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.\n\n\nWell, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a\ncar with highway miles. \nMight check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he\nhas been through.

Also, since this total rating compares players\nto league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be\nawarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great\ncareer, but I would prefer Santo\&#39;s plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.\n\nBut I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.\nThat\&#39;s a similar story, Hack\&#39;s far better hitting outweighs Traynor\&#39;s\nsuperior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better\nchoices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports\nthis point of view.)\n\nShouldn\&#39;t that be right field?\n&#39;,

  &#34;Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat\nshaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three\npicthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning\nand blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).\n\nDespite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont\nbe taken lightly.  Going into today&#39;s game, the had the league&#39;s leading\nhitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young\nand Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder&#34;,

  &#39;\nI\&#39;m afraid that I\&#39;ve lost the thread here.  I didn\&#39;t suggest that all \ngovernment regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don\&#39;t follow the \ncomments above.\n\n\nI mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally\nundesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw\nsupport among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.\n\nFurthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an\nindustrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it\nwould produce would effectively crush productive effort.\n\nNo, I\&#39;m not surprised.  I just think it\&#39;s interesting that on one hand\nlibertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other\nposit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize\nthat many libertarians assume that such a government will be \ncounterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that\nwidespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the\nestablishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)\n\nYup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement\nthat the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8),\nI\&#39;m willing to justify such programs on that basis.\n\nWell, in the first place, I don\&#39;t support a &#34;socialized economic system.&#34;\nI think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not\nthe case that &#34;any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt\nas the buyer or seller.&#34;  There are multitudes of examples where such a\nstatement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions\nthat provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one\nexample.\n\njsh\n&#39;,

  &#34;\nNope.  Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey,\nasking if people favored stricter gun controls.

  &#34;\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where\nthe water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear\ntaillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced\nthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time\nI happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The\ndealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to\nfix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same\nproblem.)  I haven&#39;t noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5\nyears, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I&#39;m going to try\nto take it back to get them to fix it again.  I&#39;m real tempted to drill some vent\nand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is\ngetting very annoying.

  &#34;\n\nThis is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is \na definition, not an assertion:\n\n   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a \n   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is\n   good. Blah blah blah.\n\nThat&#39;s about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To\nsay that something produces only good because it is only good that \nit produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And\nall you&#39;re application is saying that it&#39;s true if you really \nbelieve it&#39;s true.  That&#39;s silly.\n\nConversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under\natheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-\ndon&#39;t-believe-it-and-it-doesn&#39;t.  \n\nLike other religions I&#39;m aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and\ncaste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no\nlogical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for\nexample).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering\nwithout any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of\nsome inaccessible god.\n\nBy the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly.\nFor what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of\nterms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.\nAnd If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing\nto do with it, does it?&#34;,
  &#34;  [stuff deleted]\n\nThere are two &#39;problems&#39;:\n(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit\n    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight\n    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the\n    meantime, and\n(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first &#39;get date&#39;\n    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So\n    unless the first BIOS &#39;get date&#39; call after midnight is done by\n    the DOS &#39;kernel&#39; (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to\n    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.\nMy guess is that Kevin&#39;s &#39;menu&#39; system uses BIOS calls to read the\nclock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which\ncauses the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the &#39;menu&#39; system\n&#39;notices&#39; the day &#39;wrap&#39; (which I think is indicated by a non-zero\nvalue in AL), there really isn&#39;t any particularly good way to tell DOS\nabout it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system &#39;should&#39; use\nDOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS &#39;kernel&#39; to do\nthe BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed\nproperly.  Possibly, though, the &#39;menu&#39; system can&#39;t easily use DOS\ncalls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time\nincrementing ofters occur while the &#39;menu&#39; system is &#39;inside&#39; some\nother DOS call.&#34;,

  &#34;This was in Wed.

  &#34;\n\nI don&#39;t know why it is so obvious.  We are not speaking of acts of the \nflesh.  We are just speaking of emotions.  Emotions are not of themselves\nmoral or immoral, good or bad.  Emotions just are.  The first step is\nnot to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that\nwe hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God\naccepts us.  It seems that Paul&#39;s anger he has accepted and channeled\nit to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those\nafflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  Give in?  Calling\nhis arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action\nbecause of fear to give others a bad feeling, he&#39;s not forgiving?\n\nRe-think it, Aaron.  Don&#39;t be quick to judge.  He has forgiven those with\nAIDS, he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made\nappropriate choices for action on such feelings.  He has not given in to\nhis anger.&#34;,
  &#39;\n\nI assume that you are talking about the appeals processes, etc.?\nWell, it should be noted that people who are imprisoned for life\nwill also tend to appeal (though not quite as much in the &#34;final\nhours.&#34;\n\nAnyway, economics is not a very good reason to either favor or oppose\nthe punishment.&#39;,
  &#34;You know ed,...  You&#39;re right!  Andi shouldn&#39;t be comparing\nIsrael to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the\nNazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for\nGermany, and they would have succeeded if it weren&#39;t for the\ndamn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample\nevidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,\nand even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the\nHolocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain\nsympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n&#34;,
  &#34;\nNow, take a good look at at, an tell me man, there is no Christian\nDevil? There is, is real, is a virus, a meme, infecting and possessing\nthe good people and keep &#39;em from becoming human beings with emphasis on\nthe being! Is not a matter of good people an evil people, is all good\npeople see, but some good people vexed of the Christian Devil. An it\ncan&#39;t be burn out or lynch out or rape out. Only wise up let I rise up.\nChristian Devil is real man, how else can you explain five hundred years\nof history, even more?

  &#39;Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject\nin this post), the name &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; seems very confusable with the\n&#34;Clipper&#34; chip of Intergraph.\n\nOriginally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was\na 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,\nnotably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph\nacquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National\nSemiconductor several years back.\n\nWhen I first saw &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; in the announcement, I immediately\nthought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.\n\nThis seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I\&#39;m not a\nlawyer. I\&#39;d say I\&#39;m a cryptologist, but I don\&#39;t want to incriminate\nmyself under the laws of the new regime.\n\n-Tim May\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nRefer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:\n958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;\n1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188\n\nHe details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.\nFor a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.\n\nRogers\&#39; methods were used extensively during the World War, and was\nunclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this\nsoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.\n\nThe bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of\ntheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is\nquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which\ntravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,\nthe published data showed that when noise drowned out regular\nreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.\n\nIF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the\nman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers\&#39; methods\nwere correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely &#34;abberant&#34;.\n\n----\n ET   &#34;Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes.&#34;&#39;,
  &#39;\nYes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the\ndetails that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls\nwere working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds\ndid something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush\nand the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced\nGrahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush\n&#34;consented&#34; to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending\nincreases.\n\nAs it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps\non spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as\nPresident (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax\nincreases).\n\nThe result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level \nABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nConsiderably better than I feel about, say, the Punic Wars, or the \nPeloponnesian War (spelling optional), or almost any other event in \nclassical history.  How close to the events do you think the oldest \nextent manuscripts are in those cases?\n&#39;,
  &#39;There is a program called Graphic Workshop you can FTP from\nwuarchive.  The file is in the msdos/graphics directory and\nis called &#34;grfwk61t.zip.&#34;  This program should od everthing\nyou need.\n\n-- &#39;,

  &#39;-------------------------------------\n\t+ ............The OTIS Project \&#39;93  +      \n\t+ &#34;The Operative Term Is STIMULATE&#34; + \n\t-------------------------------------\n\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind &#34;digital immortality&#34; is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\&#39;ll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\&#39;ll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn\&#39;t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\&#39;s stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you\&#39;ve got the gumption...\nthat\&#39;s what they\&#39;re here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely &#34;anonymous FTP&#34; to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don\&#39;t forget to get busy and use the &#34;bin&#34;\ncommand to make sure you\&#39;re in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS\&#39; directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can\&#39;t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\&#39;ll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it\&#39;s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we\&#39;ll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5&#34;\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don\&#39;t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can\&#39;t...we can convert from most formats...we\&#39;d just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don\&#39;t have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we\&#39;re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you\&#39;d send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt\&#39;s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this &#34;info-file&#34; there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou\&#39;ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the &#34;.rm&#34; file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the &#34;Artists&#34; directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn\&#39;t explicitly given, then you\&#39;ll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\&#39;ll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\&#39;s always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in &#34;dos&#34; format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit &#34;code&#34; for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\&#39;s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they\&#39;d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you\&#39;d like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat\&#39;s about it for now.  More &#34;guidelines&#34; will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it\&#39;s followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n\t     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It\&#39;s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you\&#39;ve given permission for that, it\&#39;s illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don\&#39;t want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don\&#39;t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is &#34;stimulate&#34;.  If you know of people\nthat\&#39;d be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick\&#39;m\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\n&#39;,
  &#34;am amazed at the number of Harley riders who ARE waving even to a lowly\nbaby ninja.  Let&#39;s keep up the good attitudes.  Brock Yates said in this\nmonths Car and Driver he is ready for a war (against those who would rather\nwe all rode busses).  We bikers should be too.\n\nIt&#39;s a freedom that we all wanna know\nand it&#39;s an obsession to some\nto keep the world in your rearview mirror\nwhile you try to run down the sun&#34;,
  &#39;\t[Prof. Denning\&#39;s description of SkipJack mostly omitted]\n\n\tCHIP STRUCTURE\n\tThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\n\talgorithm called &#34;Skipjack.&#34;  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\n\twith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\n\tfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n\t16 Mbits a second. [...]\n\n\tF, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n\tN, a 30-bit serial number\n\tU, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted\n\t\t with the chip\n\tThe key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\n\tfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n  \t   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n\t   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThree questions:\n1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:\n\t\tE[M;K] = 64 bits\n\t\tE[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits\n\t\tE[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits\n   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,\n   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?   \n   All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications\n   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over \n\n2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?\n   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,\n   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only\n   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into\n   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?\n\n3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?\n   Does the block have to be present at all?\n   Since the receiving chip doesn\&#39;t know the transmitter\&#39;s U,\n   it presumably can\&#39;t check the validity of E[K;U], so it\&#39;s \n   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,\n   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness\n   (unless there\&#39;s some sort of back-door structure that lets\n   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)\n   \n   In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT\n   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?\n   (The chip won\&#39;t do it, so you postprocess the output.)\n   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;\n   paranoid people can use someone else\&#39;s serial number.\n\n   On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,\n   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,\n   like use message encryption that\&#39;s really E[M; K,U,N] ?\n\n\n\tThanks!&#39;,
  &#34;has no\nmitigate\nliterature,\n\nFirst, let me offer you my condolences.  I&#39;ve had kidney stones 4 times \nand I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see \na doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the\nonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a\nurinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones\nare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it\nout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she\nabsolutely won&#39;t see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps\nan over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.\nKidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed \nto make sure there is not a serious problem.&#34;,

I haven\&#39;t had a professor who didn\&#39;t,\nthough my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend\nhad an instructor who didn\&#39;t have a degree at all, but because he had\nbeen Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.\nHe had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and\nfinally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him\nto show up to teach.\n\n# a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants (TAs).\n# TAs were the slave labor, graduate students who got their tuition paid, and\n# a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt\n# work.

  &#34;I&#39;m trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band\nboxes in Motif/X.  I&#39;m running on an 8-bit display for which I&#39;ve created a\ncolormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines\nin a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I&#39;m displaying a bitmap using\nXPutImage().  If doesn&#39;t matter if the lines I draw interactively stay\naround when the window is refreshed.\n\nCurrently, to draw interactively, I begin with:\n\n   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */\n   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;\n   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;\n   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &amp;palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);\n   XFlush( myDisplay);\n\n   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);\n   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);\n\nThen to draw I do:\n\n   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);\n   XFlush( myDisplay);\n\nAnd when I&#39;m all done, to return things to normal I do:\n\n   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);\n\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of\nwhatever I&#39;m drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If\nthe lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are\nover a black area - nothing shows up!  It&#39;s very strange.  But the GXxor\nfunction seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and\nredraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).\n\nAny suggestions what I&#39;m doing wrong?&#34;,
  &#39;I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us &#34;subject to sin and death&#34; (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus &#34;fully human&#34; (Nicea) would not\nbe &#34;subject to sin&#34;, but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween &#34;human&#34; and &#34;fallen human&#34; makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius\&#39;s version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son &#34;uncreate&#34; -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\&#39;s\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept &#34;Nestorianism&#34; as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that &#34;Nestorianism&#34; is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus\&#39;s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by &#34;subject to sin&#34;.  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\&#39;t see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn\&#39;t sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\&#39;s reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n&#34;rash and dogmatic&#34; (as the editor of &#34;The Christological Controversy&#34;\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says &#34;To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.&#34;\n\nIt\&#39;s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have &#34;to some\ndegree&#34; a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there\&#39;s a certain indirectness in the Logos\&#39;\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\&#39;t have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say &#34;I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\&#39;s\nhuman nature was in heaven.&#34;  I don\&#39;t think that\&#39;s required by\northodox doctrine.  It\&#39;s the divine Logos that is eternal.&#39;,
  &#34;-- \nHi netland,\n\nI thought that I once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.\nOn the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) I can&#39;t find\nany trace of this program. Could anybody give me a hint where to find this\nprogram or confirm/deny the existance of this program.\n\nRegards,&#34;,
  &#34;Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some\nhelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn&#39;t have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can&#39;t store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It&#39;s not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.&#34;,

  &#34;\n\nIf I don&#39;t think my belief is right and everyone else&#39;s belief is wrong,\nthen I don&#39;t have a belief. This is simply what belief means.

If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find\nauthority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, \nthe mind has to start somewhere.

  &#34;\n\n  I have found that this isn&#39;t a very effective argument.  Most atheists are\nperfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are\nquite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into \nmisunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an\nanalogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan\nWar, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.\n  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to convince atheists of the validity of \nChristianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an\nunderstanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who\nwere led to Christianity by argument?&#34;,

  &#39;\n\nWell, it\&#39;s been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of\nreprinting (without permission, so sue me) Eric Haines reprint of the very\ninteresting discussion of this topic...\n\n                /Jonas\n\n                         O /         \\ O\n------------------------- X snip snip X ------------------------------\n                         O \\         / O\n\n&#34;Give a man a fish, and he\&#39;ll eat one day.\nGive a man a fishing rod, and he\&#39;ll laze around fishing and never do anything.&#34;\n\nWith that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant\ninformation posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year\&#39;s papers listed in the\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\n\n-- Eric\n\n\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\n\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\n\n\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\n\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\n\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\n\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\n\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says &#34;if a line intersects a polygon&#34;, so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See &#34;PostScript Language&#34;, by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then &#34;outputs&#34; the answer.  By\n&#34;output&#34;, we mean the program executes a command called &#34;showpage&#34;, which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\&#39;s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won\&#39;t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1.

By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman &amp; D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\&#39;s ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.  (I think there\&#39;s an \&#39;89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\ndeals with this).\n\n--&#39;,
  &#39;\nWell, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is\nbased on some fantasy of how it happened. But that\&#39;s OK, I understand you\nhave a hockey background. Stats like &#34;plus/minus&#34; make RBI look good.\n\n\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here\&#39;s a very simele question to which\nI\&#39;m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team\&#39;s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\&#39;s not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the &#34;Red Jays&#34; would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\&#39;t take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola\&#39;s as better than Morris\&#39; in the sense that &#34;had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.&#34;\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com&#39;,

  &#39;\nWhether there is a &#34;why&#34; or not we have to find it.

  &#39;Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, &#34;He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.&#34;\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&amp;R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis &#34;source&#34; had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he\&#39;d promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, &#34;I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.&#34;  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\&#39;s wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\&#39;s\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, &#34;...if it has a\ncase at all...&#34; according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife\&#39;s voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris\&#39;s survival is simply due to divine intervention.&#39;,
  &#34;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n\n\nThe point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone\nscrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to\nmy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved&#39;\ncountries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy&#39; countries will\nget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with\nA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the\ncapabilities of the base station.\n\nThe cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to\nlisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but \ncellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users\nand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular\ncalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another\nbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\ncall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider&#39;s\nequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\nlisten without having to obtain a warrant.\n\nBut, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\nto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\nabove - they don&#39;t *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\nbut even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\nwarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\nit appears he wasn&#39;t a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we&#39;ll stop\nlistening in&#39;...\n\nYou have every reason to be scared shitless.

  &#39;\n\nI assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has\nTony Campello read?  Not much it seems. \n\n\nIt is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.\nIf only those christian &#34;scientists&#34; would take note.\n\n(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian \nscientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly\ntrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified\nby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are \ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \naccounted for. :-] )\n\n\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\nup?\n\n\nMillions of people have &#34;died for a lie&#34;.  This  point is difficult to \nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\n\n  \nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\nthe claim that Jesus was the &#34;real thing&#34;.\n\n\n\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\nwas sane....\n\n \n\n\nHmmm.... I don\&#39;t think his arguments warrant the use of a &#34;Therefore...&#34;\n\n\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \n\nTony\&#39;s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say &#34;a is\nequal to b because a is equal to b&#34;.\n\n  \n\n\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\nclaiming to be correct.  \n\nIt \n\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\nthan here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments\nof a stranger should be of interest to other people. \n\nSomeone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one\nrules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I\ncould probably find the exact quotation.&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nYou are right but PLEASE DON\&#39;T DO THIS.

  &#39;According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking &#34;in X\&#39;s\nname&#34; is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus\&#39; culture authorized\nto conduct business &#34;in John\&#39;s name&#34; had full authority over John\&#39;s\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John\&#39;s benefit and consonant with John\&#39;s wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n&#34;in John\&#39;s name&#34;; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of &#34;faith&#34;.)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying &#34;in Jesus\&#39; name&#34; does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n&#34;fiduciary&#34; relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of &#34;praying in Jesus\&#39; name&#34; is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\&#39;s\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying &#34;in Jesus\&#39; name&#34; is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord\&#39;s Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words &#34;In Jesus\&#39; Name&#34; may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God\&#39;s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\&#39;m not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don\&#39;t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\&#39;s B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don\&#39;t see anything in Christ\&#39;s words to\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\nomniscience and grace.\n\nVan Kelly\nvek@research.att.com\n&#39;,

  &#34;\nSplitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the\ncombustion chamber. If an engine&#39;s cylinder head design can benefit from this,\nthen the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably\nin lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn&#39;t do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC\npickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley\nSportster 1200 and my best friend&#39;s 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who&#39;ve\ntried them in 1340 Evo motors can&#39;t tell any performance boost over plain\nplugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers\nare pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who\nhave shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,\nI&#39;d dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make\nthe machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look\nreally cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)&#34;,

He called them &#34;the Great Commission&#34; but this is NOT\ndescriptive of Jesus\&#39;s words in Matt. 10:15.\n\nMatt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:\n\n\t&#34;And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have\n\tto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust\n\tfrom your feet.&#34;\n\nMatt. 10:15:\n\n \t&#34;I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not \n \tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with \n \tthat town.&#34;\n\n\n&#34;&gt; The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on\n &gt; shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.&#34;\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^\n\nThe highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.\n\nAnd Dean countered:\n\n&#34;Actually, this comment of your\&#39;s is a perfect example of what an\nintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I\nspecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty\nto spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\ncharacterize that as &#34;ignoring&#34; the instruction to spread the\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.&#34;\n\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of &#34;instruction\nto spread the word.&#34;\n\nAll these quotes btw are from:\n\nMessage-ID: &lt;1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com&gt;\n\n\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\n\n&#34;Do you, too, measure\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?&#34;\n\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\n\n&#34;Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\&#39;re just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\nthe sport is all there is.&#34;\n\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\n\n&#34;So I now restore the answer to your question\nthat you deleted.  If you\&#39;re still unable to figure it out, ask\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\ndoesn\&#39;t take much sophistication to understand.&#34;\n\nOn top of which, I doubt that the &#34;answer&#34; is at all representative\nof Dean\&#39;s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\&#39;s \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean\&#39;s mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n&#34;You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe &#34;sins&#34; of other individuals.&#34;\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\&#39;s sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the &#34;sins&#34; of others\n--&#34;sins&#34;, BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n&#34;You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to &#34;paint Jews as plaster saints,&#34; thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.&#34;\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about &#34;plaster saints&#34;, \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.&#39;,

My system takes about 45 minutes to do \n\tthe same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape \n\tis grinding away the whole time means that your block size for \n\tthe write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block \n\tsize or write buffer size so it\&#39;s bigger?\n\n\n\tThis is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the \n\tTAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration\n\tfile for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup\n\tfrom DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.\n\n\n\tThe 250mb cartridges won\&#39;t do you any good since the drive\n\twon\&#39;t write 250mb of physical data on the tape.  \n\n&#39;,

  &#39;\nIf you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?\n\n\nWell, make up your mind.    Is it to be &#34;instinctive not to murder&#34;\nor not?\n\n\nIt\&#39;s not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill\none another.\n\n\nSigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.\n\nI think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.\nI am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as\nprimates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem\nto exhibit self-awareness.\n\n\nSo what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals\nhas a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your\nnatural morality&gt;\n\n\n\nAre you blind?   What do you think that this sentence means?\n\n\t&#34;There must be the possibility that the organism - it\&#39;s not \n\tjust people we are talking about - can consider alternatives.&#34;\n\nWhat would that imply?\n\n\nI find the fact that they do to be significant. &#39;,
  &#39;\nYou assume this because you believe in a designing creator,\nand you observe our ability to procreate...\n\n\n.... But then you observe our ability to modify fertility\nthrough intelligence &amp; experiment, and draw no similar conclusions\nabout God designing us for scientific inquiry &amp; the use of the\ntechnology that it produces.  How is it that one ability is &#34;obviously\nfrom God&#34;, and the other not?\n\n\nI want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most\nbasic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement\nrelies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that\nassert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not\ncompelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.\nFalsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows\ncorrupting both the intellect and the heart.\n\n\nIf there is a God, he has nothing to fear from truth.\nAs to imaginary gods and there followers: Be afraid. Be very\nafraid.&#39;,

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two &#34;errors&#34; at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\&#39;t think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \nWhile most of my faxes were received in &#34;standard&#34; mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \ntoo small. \n\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\n                         ============================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n                                 Introduction\n\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, &#34;Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.&#34; Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in &#34;jumbo&#34; patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\&#39;s Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture\&#39;s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC\&#39;s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked &#34;Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?&#34; and &#34;Do you use snuff now?&#34; Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors\&#39; access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

  &#39;Dear Rob,\n\n\nSometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that\nway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\&#39;ll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\&#39;t see it.   Here\&#39;s is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  &#34;Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.&#34; \n\nBK:  &#34;There is no truck.&#34;\n\nMe:  &#34;Turn around at look.&#34;\n\nBK:  &#34;No.&#34;\n\nMe:  &#34;Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.&#34;\n\nBK:  &#34;No. Explain to me why trucks exist.&#34;\n\nMe:  &#34;Turn around or you will run over.&#34;\n\nBK:  &#34;No. I won\&#39;t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.&#34;\n\nMe:  &#34;You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.&#34;\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  &#34;It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.&#34;\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.&#34;\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn\&#39;t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. &#39;,
  &#34;Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040\naccelerator?  There seem to be plenty of accelerator/graphics cards for\nthe _SE_, but none (that I&#39;ve seen) for the SE/30.\n\nThanks&#34;,
  &#39;\nI wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was\njust making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the\nexamples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even\nwhen only one league expanded.\n\nSo (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues\nbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making \nevery team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up\nplayers that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.&#39;,

  &#34;Hi folks!\t\t\n\nRecently saw one post about KREME being a *bad idea*, but that was only\t\none man&#39;s opinion.  \t&#34;,
  &#39;\nYea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared\nfor lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).\nI guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written\nspecs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup\nsection says Apple 14&#34; and 16&#34; monitors can go on top, but 21&#34; and other\nbig ones can\&#39;t.  Why couldn\&#39;t they publish a maximum load?\n\nNow if I can figure out if there\&#39;s any hope using the &#34;partition&#34; button\non the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),\nthen maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more\nsecurly.  The &#34;getting more information&#34; section of the manual suggested\ntrying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn\&#39;t mention the net.&#39;,
  &#39;&#39;,
  &#39;Hey!? What happened to the solar sail race that was supposed to be\nfor Columbus+500?&#39;,
  &#39;\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\nis only because of God\&#39;s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \n\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\&#39;s fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n(\&#39;21) and Philosophical Investigation (\&#39;53).  Many of Witt\&#39;s comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\&#39;s\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\&#39;s own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights\&#39;s comment that Witt\&#39;s &#34;sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.&#34;  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt\&#39;s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John\&#39;s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of &#34;as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.&#34;  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\&#39;t shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\&#39;s Sweetie\&#39;s conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n&#34;I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me.&#34;  Job 23ff\n\n--Rex&#39;,
  &#39;\n\nIn order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and\n(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what\&#39;s it got to do\nwith the discussion at hand? :-)\n\nWhen I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes\nagainst different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which\nallow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the\nconvict\&#39;s attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit\ninto that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of\nthe standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,\nethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about\nclasses based upon one\&#39;s _profession_ rather than one\&#39;s personal\ncharacteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question\nfrom scratch.\n\nWhat I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such\nclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declare\nsome people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema\nto the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.\n\nLast year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would\nhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus\ncrimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not\nprotected by that &#34;aura of deterrence,&#34; critics pointed out the\nabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the\nmurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a\ncivilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more\nvalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.\nThis was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of\nthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge\nsome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their\n&#34;contribution to society.&#34;  I view that doctrine as being both (a)\npersonally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of\nthe 14th Amendment.\n\nAccordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any\nprofession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism\nof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of\nthat class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking\nmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.&#39;,
  &#34;\n\nI have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to\nneighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA)\nI found that there were few states in the provences that stood\nout in this youngster&#39;s mind: California, Texas, and Florida to \nname the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin\nstuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have \nalways translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.\nAnd my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that\nstate&#39;s reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the\nsame.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left\nwith me about their neighbors.\n\nThe only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is \nwhether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between\ncheese and serial killers :)&#34;,

  &#34;\n\nWe had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.\nThere was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can\nwith touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).\n\nEventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases\nwhere the owner of the car could prove he didn&#39;t drive it at the time\nof speeding.\n\nI especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that\nhad stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number\nof a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...\n\nIn conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!&#34;,

  &#34;I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a \nNuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color \nis possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan\nrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it\ncan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a\nsoftware control panel.\n\n  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw \ncalls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing\nup the mac processor for other tasks. \n\n  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night\nwas $1738 at Mac&#39;s Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just\nover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the\noriginal manuals.\n\n  Hurry!&#34;,
  &#39;\nI don\&#39;t personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  \n\nUnfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn\&#39;t as good an example as Nieves would\nhave been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous\nyears (which I didn\&#39;t have access to).\n\nThe point remains, though; knowing a guy\&#39;s minor league history is as good\nas knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.\n\n\nThe MLE is not a *projection*, it\&#39;s an *equivalence*.  It\&#39;s a &#34;this is how\nwell he hit *last* year, in major league terms&#34; rating.  So, in essence, he\nhas *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half\nof all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe\nmore than half, since all of these players are young and improving.\n\n\nDid they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place\nand last place, but no more.\n\n\nSure; they didn\&#39;t have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the\nfarm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really\nin contention. \n\n\nIf you\&#39;d read what I wrote, you\&#39;d be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put\nany credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn\&#39;t\ndone anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training\ncould interpret as &#34;failure&#34;.  Just because I think spring training numbers\nare meaningless doesn\&#39;t mean that Bobby Cox does; it\&#39;s just a case of ruling\nout one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.\n\n\nKeith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,\nthen did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.\n\n&#39;,

  &#39;Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\n\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government\&#39;s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper\&#39;s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper\&#39;s statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, &#34;You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It\&#39;s difficult to remember what went on first.&#34;\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a &#34;9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.&#34; [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\&#39;s dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\&#39;s\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August\&#39;s events, Cooper responded, &#34;If\nyou\&#39;re implying that we got our story together, you\&#39;re wrong,\ncounselor.&#34;  Spence continued to advance the defense\&#39;s version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver\&#39;s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\&#39;s\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense\&#39;s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  &#34;I\&#39;m not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.&#34;\n\nSpence told the judge that, &#34;When all the evidence is in, we\&#39;ll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.&#34; \nSpence continued, &#34;We\&#39;re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.&#34;\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\&#39;s repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, &#34;We can\&#39;t have a fair trial if the\njury believes I\&#39;m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\&#39;m\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\&#39;m\nviolating court orders.&#34;\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\&#39;s\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was &#34;preposterous&#34; and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution\&#39;s purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\&#39;s credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\&#39; other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver\&#39;s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, &#34;I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.&#34;&#39;,
  &#34;Why don&#39;t you look again at Motor Trend&#39;s, slalom times, they are 67.9, right\nalong with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that\nare all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than\na Beretta.\nYour acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine\nRoad &amp; Track and Car&amp; Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.\nAlso Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1\nYou can&#39;t tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will\ndefinately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car &amp; Driver and Road &amp; track\nhave the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.\n\n\n***You always believe those exact numbers, why don&#39;t you drive a GS-R, and see\nfor your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000\nrpm make up for the difference (still wouldn&#39;t call it a torque moster though!)\n\n\nQuad 4 reliable, yeah, what&#39;s your definition of reliable- if that&#39;s reliable,\nthen its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect\n (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine\n   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,\nand you&#39;ll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak\nfrom expierence!)\nI&#39;m not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don&#39;t highlight reliability when you\ncomparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a\nbetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And\ndoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.&#34;,

  &#34;\n   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n   This will be the the first time I&#39;ve taken anyone for an extended ride\n   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We&#39;ll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nI&#39;d say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something\nmuch mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.\nThat particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of\nthing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.\n\nOnce you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do\nsomething longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road\nlike Mines-Mt. Hamilton.\n\nIn any case, it&#39;s *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she\nhas proper gear that fits - especially if you&#39;re going sport\nriding.&#34;,

  &#34;\nSo what does that have to do with RBI&#39;s?  The team with the most RBI&#39;s\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily win the game.\n\nYes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does\nevery newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)\n\nBut for an individual player, runs and RBIs are context-dependent, and tell\nus very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and\nposition in the batting order.&#34;,
  &#39;Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of\ndoing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading\nthis group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5\ndifferent groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts\na week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\nfor discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\nJust curious.\n&#39;,
  &#39;Hi\n\tI have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\&#39;t just say &#34;Buy the memory\nfrom us&#34; or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\&#39;t have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was &#34;Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid\&#39;s software developers are busy with other projects.&#34;\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\&#39;d love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it\&#39;s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\&#39;re\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are &#34;less\nbusy&#34;.  If the magazines are to believed, I\&#39;ve only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.&#39;,

  &#34;Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 19-Apr-93 Monthly Question about\nXCop.. Buzz Moschetti@bear.com (1055) \n\n\nHmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all\nforbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any\ninternal data structures should be maintained such that the visual\nappearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens\nto be generated.  This doesn&#39;t preclude drawing immediately after\nupdating the datastructures though... &#34;,

  &#34;Responding to the moderator:\n\n\nYes, I agree.  What I&#39;m trying to point out is that, in matters of faith\n(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced\nof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal\nrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those\nbeliefs with others.  And I don&#39;t think that its arrogant, persay, to\naccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the\nconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs\narise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God \nmust reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would \nhonestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone \nwho disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are \nrejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient \nfor them, or because they wish to spurn God.\n\nI would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one \nholds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is \nthat it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with\nGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas\nof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or \nrevealed that truth.  \n\n-- \ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu&#34;,
  &#39;\nScience is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed\ninterpretations of our observations (perceptions).\n\n\nValues can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science the\nvalue of 1 is TRUE, and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreed\nvalues (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a\nreinterpretation of these values.\n\n\nThe values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been\nfully agreed, and the change with time.  The values of Newtonian physic are\ncertainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics.&#39;,

  &#39;Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones [1]\n\t\n\t\tCopyright, 1924, by the New York Times Company\n\t\t\tSpecial Cable to The New York Times\n\n   PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in\nthat port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a\nmysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there.\nThe bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and\nto be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the\nrumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.\n\n\t\t\t- - - Reference - - -\n\n[1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)\n\n\t\t\t- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nOn the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,\nwe remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an \nemerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\&#39;s Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\n\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \n&#34;rebels&#34;.\n\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\n\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \nArmenians were a &#34;threat&#34;.\n\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\n\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey\&#39;s Kurdish\npopulation.\n\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\n\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;\nSuperficially a good answer, but it isn\&#39;t that simple.  An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\&#39;ve got.\n\nPerhaps it\&#39;s more accurate to say that there\&#39;s a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\&#39;t give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed &#34;Pro-Life&#34; movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they\&#39;re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne\&#39;s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\&#39;t believe this to be the case.\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\n\n[...]\n\nNote that I _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the\nnuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex.  I specifically\nsaid that it was &#34;a prime cause&#34; of this, not &#34;the prime cause&#34; or &#34;the\nonly cause&#34; of this -- I recognize that there are probably other factors\ntoo, but I think that extra-marital sex and subsequent destabilization\nof the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in\npsychological problems, including depression, in the West in the 20th\ncentury.&#39;,
  &#39;\nI don\&#39;t care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single\nline item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as\nwrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at \nMarquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or\nEmbry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance\nthat I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our\nUniversity who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did\nnot happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead\nto be a legitimate charge.\n\n\nI did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that\nany percentage number like this is included in the overhead.\n\n\nNo Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee\nof the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont\nbetter or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.\nKinda funny isn\&#39;t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\nat a place where everything is overhead.\n\n\nWhy did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\ndemanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \nselective with the facts again.\n\n\nIf it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\nof 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your\n&#34;friend&#34; at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it\nfor a billion a year &#34;if the wrap were gone&#34;. This merely points out a \nblatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.\n\nDennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville.&#39;,

  &#39;\nsome deleted\n\n\nDear Will,\n\nI\&#39;ve never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok.\nI had a few thoughts!:\n\n&#34;Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead&#34; - James 2:17\n\nFaith is both belief and action.\nIf I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a\nswimmer? and will people believe that I am?\nLikewise if I say I\&#39;m a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a\nChristian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to\nGod proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!\n\nIn a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6\nv3 says &#34;We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands&#34;\nI find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that \&#39;if we have\ncome to know Him, then we\&#39;ll obey His commands\&#39; cos He lives within us and\nwe cannot help but obey what He says.\nI tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing\nus into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically\nproduced in our lives.\n\nHope this helps.&#39;,
  &#39;\nI don\&#39;t find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have\nsupplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the\nfuture (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to\ndecap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating\nhigh-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn\&#39;t care less), I am not \ngoing to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the\nreal me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business\nreasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that\nwe\&#39;re not the main threat.\n\nI also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon\ncould possibly be called &#34;classified.&#34;  It\&#39;s like handing out military\nsecrets to the whole world in envelopes marked &#34;don\&#39;t open me.&#34;  I can\nimagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to\na trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government\&#39;s actions.\n\n\nAmusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable\nfor a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?\nIn DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you\njust swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect\non the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of\nthat cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer\&#39;s designers were well aware that\nit would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search\nalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.\nI have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  \nHowever, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its \ndesigners would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion \nof such techniques seems credible.\n\nHmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name\n&#34;Clipper&#34; for this device. :)\n&#39;,

  &#39;\nAnything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. \n(If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)\n\nThis implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should\nnever be satisfied. It does not imply that\nhaving fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.\nIt does imply that I sin every day.\n\nA perhaps simpler definition:\nAnything that is counter to the two Great Commandments: \nlove God, love your neighbor, is a sin.\nAnything I do that is not from love is a sin.\n\nThe same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.\n\nI could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them,\nconsidering only to teach them proper behavior, or I could yell at my\nkids out of anger or selfishness.\n\nI could post an excellent article because I am interested in sharing\nmy opinions and getting feedback and learning, or I could post an\narticle because I want everyone to realize how wise I am.&#39;,
  &#39;\n     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?\n\nTheir distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,\ncrudely speaking, indicates we\&#39;re seeing an edge to the distribution.\n\n   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are\n   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?\n\n   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   \n\nNow, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the\ngamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that\nGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population\n(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic\nhalo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)\n(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was\nprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)\n\tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo\npopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population is\nruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you\nhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism\nof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start\nto see for example the Andromeda\&#39;s bursters.\n\tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution\n(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with\nthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence\nisotropy) and the edge is &#34;the edge of the Universe&#34; ;-)\nIf at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)\nand a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star\ncolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\n\n\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\nthey\&#39;d actually probably fit relatively easily into the\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\n\n   my own pet theory is that it\&#39;s  Flying saucers  entering\n   hyperspace :-)\n\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...&#39;,

  &#39;\nI totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further\nand advocate violating what God has set up?  That is the question which\nyou have not answered from Scripture.  You can worship on every day, as\nlong as you work.  But God says the Sabbath is all mine.&#39;,

It is fast moving out\nof t.a scope, but I didn\&#39;t know if t.a was the only group of the three\nthat you subscribed to.\nApologies to regular t.a folks.\n\n\n\nYou must be using \&#39;values\&#39; to mean something different from the way I\nsee it used normally.\n\nAnd you are certainly using \&#39;Science\&#39; like that if you equate it to\n&#34;the real world&#34;.\n\nScience is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe\nand the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning\nthose perceptions.\n\nIt has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.\nValues are ... well they are what I value.\nThey are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience\nrather than not, and so on.\n\nObjective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are\napplicable to everyone.\n\n\nI don\&#39;t agree.\nScience is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are\naccurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on\nmy perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)\nversus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.\n\nBut values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the \nperceptions :-)\n\n\nI don\&#39;t see why.\n\&#39;Usefulness\&#39; in science is synonomous with \&#39;accuracy\&#39; - period.\nTarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or\ncan\&#39;t be shown to be accurate.\nScience is useful because it is apparently accurate.\n\nValues - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.\n\nNo?&#39;,
  &#39;The following press release was distributed April 1 by\nNASA Headquarters.\n\nSpace Station Redesign Advisory Members Named\n\nAlong with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President\nAlbert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the\nSpace Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives\nfrom government and industry and academic experts from across the\ncountry to participate in an independent review of the redesign\noptions being developed by NASA.\n\n&#34;I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this\nimportant review panel. America\&#39;s future in science and\ntechnology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost\nattention and care,&#34; said Vest. &#34;We have assembled a diverse\npanel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate\nmeasures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical\ntask.&#34;\n\nThe advisory committee is charged with independently assessing\nvarious redesign options of the space station presented by NASA\&#39;s\nredesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve\nefficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space\nstation international partners also are being asked to \nparticipate and will be named at a later date. The advisory\ncommittee will submit its recommendations in June.\n\nAdvisory committee members named today include:\n\nDr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby Alford\nPresident, MIT                Executive VP &amp; Dean of Medicine\n                              Baylor College of Medicine\n\nMr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul Chu\nPresident, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for\n                              Superconductivity\n                              University of Houston\n\nDr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John Fabian\nProf of Aero &amp; Astro          President &amp; CEO\nMIT                           ANSER\n\nMaj.

  &#34;A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs\nor true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory\n(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder\ncomes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or\nsounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple&#39;s\nmemory control panel.  Apple&#39;s cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and\nso is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the\nothers until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods\nmentioned above).\n\nWell, here&#39;s my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got\nthis information:\n\n%%% Memory info %%%\n\nPhysical RAM size: 20480K.\nLogical RAM size: 20480K.\nSize of Low Memory Area: 8K.\nVirtual Memory: Inactive.\nAddressing mode: 32bit mode in use.\n32 bit System zone: Absent.\nParity RAM: Not capable.\nGrowable System Heap: True.\nTemporary memory support: Present.\nTempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.\n\nNote that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?\nHow can I turn this on?  Any ideas?\n\nCan anyone help?&#34;,

  &#39;\n\n\n\nWell put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media\&#39;s complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What\&#39;s going on here?\n\nLet\&#39;s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI\&#39;m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I\&#39;ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\&#39;s behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\&#39;s religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform &#34;gas insertions&#34; (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\&#39;s attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\&#39;s major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n&#34;gas insertion&#34; right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet\&#39;s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my \nvery soul.\n\nJohn&#39;,
  &#39;\nSnort.  Ah, there go my sinuses again.\n\n\nOh, wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey, they laughed at Einstein, too!\n\n\nYeah, I\&#39;ll bet.  Tomorrow, the world.\n\nListen, uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.\n\n\nI\&#39;m sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric/hypochondriac who\nresponds to &#34;miracle cures.&#34;\n\n\nYeah, &#34;it makes sense to me&#34;, so of course it should be taken seriously.\nSnort.\n\n\nYeah, &#34;it sounds reasonable to me&#34;.\n\n\nOh, really?  _What_ tests?  Immune-compromised, my ass.\nMore like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.\n\n\nYou know, it\&#39;s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused\nin this way.  It\&#39;s ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic.\nThe trouble is that it isn\&#39;t toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.\n\n\nThe only good thing about nystatin is that it\&#39;s (relatively) cheap\nand when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any\nsystemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without\nany effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use\nIV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve\nthe &#34;yeast&#34; problem once and for all.\n\n\nPerhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating\nyour symptoms.\n\nAre you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?  I\&#39;d hate\nto think my insurance premiums are going towards this.\n&#39;,

I find it real ironic this happened the same day Al Gore\narrived in Poland to recognize the sacrifices made in the Warsaw Ghetto where\nthe same &#39;justifications&#39; were raised for an armed assault by black-clad troops\nwith armor support...  \n&#34;,
  &#39;This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\nthe one originally posted in January \&#39;93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\nproposed groups are described below:\n\nNAME: \t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\n\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\n\nNAME:\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\nSTATUS:\t Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\n\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\n\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\n\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\n\tto argue about the meaning of an &#34;OS&#34;).  The family ranges from\n\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\n\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\n\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\n\tactual release is slated for May/June \&#39;93.\n\n\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\n\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\n\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\n\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\n\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\n\tWindows 3.1.\n\n\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\n\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\n\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\n\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\n\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\n\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\n\n\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\n\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\n\t\n\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\n\twell as Windows 3.1:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\n\t\n\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\n\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\n\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\n\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\n\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\n\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\n\n\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\n\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\n\tgeneration Windows, &#34;Chicago&#34;, debuts next year, surely it should\n\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\n\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\n\n\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\n\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \n\nVOTING:\n\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\n\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\n\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nAnyone care to speculate on this? I\&#39;ll let the rest of the net judge\nthis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  \&#39;specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\&#39; \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government\&#39;s policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: &#34;Bristol Papers&#34;, General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n&#34;I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village.&#34;\n\n\nSources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), &#34;Islam Ahalinin \nDucar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,&#34; (Istanbul, 1918). \nThe French version: &#34;Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens\nsur la Population Musulmane,&#34; (Istanbul, 1919).

When the Russian army\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\n left behind after their occupation of this area.&#34;\n \nSerdar Argic&#39;,
  &#39;1.  Did you read the FAQs?\n\n2.  If NO, Read the FAQs.\n\n3.  IF YES, you wouldn\&#39;t have posted such drivel.  The &#34;Lord, Liar\n    or Lunatic&#34; argument is a false trilemma.  Even if you disprove\n    Liar and Lunatic (which you haven\&#39;t), you have not eliminated\n    the other possibilities, such as Mistaken, Misdirected, or\n    Misunderstood.  You have arbitrarily set up three and only\n    three possibilities without considering others.\n\n4.  Read a good book on rhetoric and critical thinking.  If\n    you think the &#34;Lord, Liar, or Lunatic&#34; discussion is an\n    example of a good argument, you are in need of learning.\n\n5.

  &#39;Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a &#34;boxer&#34; type fan by installing\na capacitor in series with the fan\&#39;s power supply.  The air flow of\nsmall 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4\nuF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working\nvoltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is\nusually required to experimentally determine the best size\ncapacitor for a given application.\n\nFor DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.\nIt can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is\nexceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who\nmade the fans for Radio Shack.\n\n&#39;,
  &#39;:tarnold@vnet.IBM.COM (Todd W.

The devious user\n:&gt;can either modify the object code before running the program, or he can run\n:&gt;the program under a debugger and change the instructions in memory.\n:There is a way to foil debuggers, by clearing the single step \n:interrupt, on which a debugger depends, every few instructions in \n:the sensitive areas of the code.\n\nThis assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X86\ntype processor.  It can be negated by NOP\&#39;ing the clear debug instruction,\nor by running the code on a machine simulator, like one I wrote as a senior\nproject in college.  It can bypass and trace practically anything one could\nwrite in software.  Kind of like being on a Star Trek Holideck :-).\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nWho says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says?

Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church \nstating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation\nand made it all null and void.. \n\nWhat can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your\nservices as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what\never.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..\nBasically find a country who wants to go into space, but can\&#39;t for soem reason\nor another, but who will give you a &#34;home&#34;.. Such as Saudia Arabia or\nwhatever..\nThere are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and\noffer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..\nAlso once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.\nThe UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will\nnot care.. \nIf your worried about the US, do the same thing..\n\nWhy be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many\nother things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what\never..\nBasically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a\nlittle bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to\npiss off..

  &#34;Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part09\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 9: Other Miscellany\n\nThis is the ninth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don&#39;t have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don&#39;t ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]&#39;&#39; refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40&#39;s, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford&#39;s book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government&#39;s code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson&#39;s `gentlemen&#39;, but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.&#39;&#39;\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn&#39;t do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King &lt;kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com&gt;.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn&#39;t appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram&#39;&#39; includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?&#39;&#39;, which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: &lt;voynich-request@rand.org&gt;\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich&#34;,

  &#34;\nThe point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being\na gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this\narea (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that\npeople in Illinois don&#39;t carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like\nthat when there are other people around wasn&#39;t too bright of an idea.\n\n\nI agree.      If you don&#39;t practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you\nmost likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.&#34;,

  &#39;\nIt is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in\ntheir signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your\nposting). Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid\naddressing ladies with &#34;Mr.&#34;, as you have done.\n\nSecondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has\nnever been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed\nof Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and\nthe demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey\&#39;s \nmilitary intervention to it under international agreements.\n\nBe that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what\nis going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist\npolicy that Armenia is now pursuing.\n\nBut, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political\nconduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as\n&#34;itchy-bitchy&#34;... \n\nOnur Yalcin\n&#39;,

The\nRangers, who won the President&#39;s Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the\nend of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers.\nThe Flyers&#39; fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because\nthey were very interested in him.

  &#39;-*----\nI agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in\nthis thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand\non two of her comments.\n\n\nOne of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning\nabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,\nscope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of\nevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the\nback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be\nfilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a\ngrave mistake to confuse these.\n\nPast snippets from this thread:\n\n\n\nBack to Lee Lady:\n\n\nThese posters are making the mistake that I have previously\ncriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A &#34;carefully\ndesigned and controlled study&#34; is neither always possible nor\nalways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a\nremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we\nhave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind\nof claim to ask for a &#34;carefully designed and controlled study&#34;\nto alleviate our skepticism.)\n\nRules such as &#34;support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and\ncontrolled study&#34; are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.\nI think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be\nconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have\noccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To\nreuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\nuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\nproblems are notoriously problematic.)  &#39;,

  &#39;\n[stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted]\n\nThe Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the\nSHO. \n\nIts hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because\nof the suspension.\n\n\nYes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In\nmy mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90\nor so. It just isn\&#39;t safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs\noutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in\njunkyards.\n\nI find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the\nMustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least\nstandardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0\&#39;s.\n\n\n\n\nTrue of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.\n\nKindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the \&#39;30\&#39;s.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n&#34;Autobahn&#34; is the german word for freeway. Other countries have\ndifferent names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway\netc.\n\n\nEurope did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn\&#39;t passed as\nfar as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than\nthe US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred\nto the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things\nyou really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more\nprofessional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars\nrunning parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.\n\n\nYou\&#39;re wrong. GTI\&#39;s  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal\n\nautobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers\nfoot on the floor. How do I know? - when you\&#39;re not making any ground\non the identical car in front of you!\n\n\nIf something happens at 130-150 you\&#39;re dead, but the same goes for much\nover 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much\nsafer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic\nbecause most people seem to be awake. I\&#39;ve never seen any driver reading\na book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.\n\nCraig\n\nIt just doesn\&#39;t *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody\ndrives that fast, no big deal. &#39;,

  &#39;Hello again netters,\n\tI finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00.

It requires a PC with 4 Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos 5.0 or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card.\n\tThanks for all your replies about the product.

  &#39;\nThe best info I have seen so far is the article &#34;Joystick Metrics:\nMeasuring physical properties through the PC\&#39;s joystick port&#34; by\nMichael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.

The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical\nReference under Options and Adapters.

  &#34;Ann Jackson (ajackson@cs.ubc.ca) wrote on 5 May:\n\n\n\n\nI would like to submit the following which helped me enormously.\nIf it has already been posted, I apologize.\n\nIt seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to \nexplain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water.\nWater is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor.\nThus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.\n\nAnd recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I\nalso found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three\nways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and\nan employee in a business.\n\nThus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on one&#39;s particular\nneed for Him.&#34;,
  &#34;\nI&#39;m an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I\nftp&#39;ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit\nthem via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access\ninternet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC\nfile server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk\nto a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress\nand un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error\nin the tar process about directories being invalid.\nWhat I&#39;m wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,\nbinary,ascii) about multiple platforms.

  &#34;\nI totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They\nobviously don&#39;t listen to the people or want the people to know who is\nresponsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip\nrelease, to see what the entity &#39;clipper&#39; was, and got a few lists.\nBUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)\nDoes not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability\nor information they don&#39;t control given to the people.  The secret\ndevelopment and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further\nbacks that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software\nwill be considered &#39;terrorist tools&#39; and also subject to civil forfeiture,\nalong with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.\n\nThe government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking\nit back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media\nfor propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if\nClinton&#39;s agenda succeeds)...   Those that do not play ball?

  &#39;\nmy $.02 - Yes and No.  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible.  \nEither they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else \nthey are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.\n   Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are \nso committed, nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can \ncome to know someone\&#39;s situation is listening to their own statements.  This \ncan be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.\n\n\nRegarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church \n(at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks \nabout their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of \nconcern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).\n\n   Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if \nyou catch the two meanings.\n   I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either &#34;on fire \nfor Him&#34; or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made \naware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children, not eternal \ndamnation.\n\n&#39;,
  &#34;\n\nI don&#39;t know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th\nKeypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to\nalways know the state of modifiers even if your windows don&#39;t have the\nkeyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root\nwindow.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have\nbeen pressed.\n\n\nI think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.\nYou can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses\nas you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from\nthe Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.&#34;,

  &#39;In &lt;1993Apr15.045651.6892@midway.uchicago.edu&gt;, thf2@midway.uchicago.edu sez:\n\nEven if Brett\&#39;s eventual-return figures were correct -- and they\nclearly weren\&#39;t -- he\&#39;d still be wrong about the cause for the \&#39;86\nblip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:\n\n1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find\noneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term\nthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a\nfew weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with\npreferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.\n\n2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of\nwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects\nbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to\nunsophisticated investors in late 1986 to &#34;sell now and save on\ntaxes.&#34;  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar\nadvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice\nwas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),\nbut merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates\n(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).\n\nIt\&#39;s nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal\neconomic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless\npulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe\naccurately what happens in the real world.\n\n&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nWell, these are Armenian and Jewish scholars, not me. Denying the obvious?\n\n\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\n\n&#34;The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia\&#39;s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\&#39;s ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.&#34; \n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of \n Transcaucasia).\n\nIn 1920, \&#39;0\&#39; percent Turk. \n\n&#34;We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.&#34; \n\n                             Ohanus Appressian\n                            &#34;Men Are Like That&#34;\n                                   p. 202.\n\n\n &#34;In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.\n  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us\n  create for ourselves.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire\&#39;s eastern provinces,\nmassacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly \npeople, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated \nthe entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between \n1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe.

Close to 1000 people are reported to have been \nmassacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten \nand shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed \nthe Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian \ninsurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the\nKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City \nhospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant \nwere killed.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\&#39;s main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  &#34;[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him \&#39;Jesus\&#39; (which means G\&#39;d is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins.&#34;  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G\&#39;d said to Isaiah, &#34;go to meet with Ahaz...&#34; \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, &#34;Ask a sign of G\&#39;d your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.&#34;  But,\n       Ahaz said, &#34;I won\&#39;t ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.&#34;  Then (Isaiah) said, &#34;Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       &#34;Immanuel,&#34; which means, &#34;G\&#39;d is with us.&#34;   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word &#34;almah,&#34; (young woman), as\nspecifically, &#34;virgin.&#34;  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G\&#39;d walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus\&#39;s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       &#34;Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.&#34;\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\&#39;als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\&#39;s oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\&#39;d.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       &#34;A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.&#34;   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are &#34;no\nmore.&#34;  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her &#34;children,&#34;\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n&#34;on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).&#34;\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\&#39;s life to enhance\nthe message of the church\&#39;s gospel.\n       Because of the whole story\&#39;s similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The &#34;children&#34; the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\&#39;d\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew\&#39;s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the &#34;prophecy&#34; Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph &amp; wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, &#34;He shall be called a Nazarene.&#34;\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who &#34;He&#34; is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\&#39;s mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  &#34;...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.&#34;\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\&#39;d. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, &#34;He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.&#34;\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah\&#39;s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations\&#39; salvation by G\&#39;d.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a &#34;servant&#34; going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\&#39;s parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\&#39;t arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       &#34;Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.&#34;\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the &#34;light&#34; of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG\&#39;d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G\&#39;d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic &#34;...the coastlands await his law.&#34; to the\nChristologic, &#34;the Gentiles will hope in his name.&#34;   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of &#34;believing in the name.&#34;  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, &#34;a people robbed and\nplundered...&#34;   So, we see that when Matthew\&#39;s attempt at\n&#34;prophecy&#34; is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a &#34;day&#34; was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\&#39;t forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the &#34;ninth\nhour,&#34; which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, &#34;rose,&#34;\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\&#39;s little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod\&#39;s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &amp;\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the &#34;plain&#34; message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       &#34;You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people\&#39;s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.&#34;\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\&#39;d,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\&#39;d said, &#34;Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.\&#39;   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.&#34;  Then Isaiah said, &#34;How long,\n       lord?&#34;  And he said, &#34;Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\&#39;ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.&#34; The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G\&#39;d who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet\&#39;s warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon\&#39;s (and David\&#39;s) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G\&#39;d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah\&#39;s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\&#39;t\nunderstand Jesus\&#39;s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\&#39;s verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\&#39;d to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\&#39;s prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\&#39;s parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, &#34;I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.&#34;\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew\&#39;s gospel even inserted Isaiah\&#39;s name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things &#34;known, that our fathers have told\nus.&#34;  Jesus deals with things &#34;hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.&#34;  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew\&#39;s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\&#39;s prophecies aren\&#39;t the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to &#34;dispossess&#34; the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn\&#39;t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman\&#39;s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\&#39;t get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We\&#39;re too lazy; we\&#39;re not zealous enough; we\&#39;re\n       sinful; it\&#39;s just his &#34;plan&#34;; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G\&#39;d\&#39;s appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\&#39;d on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\&#39;d.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G\&#39;d.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that\&#39;s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\&#39;ve seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\&#39;d.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\&#39;d.  Sometimes, they\nsay, &#34;See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\&#39;d.&#34;   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\&#39;d into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\&#39;d as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G\&#39;d the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian &amp; Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\x0c\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, &#34;Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.&#34;\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn\&#39;t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\&#39;s version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\&#39;t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\&#39;\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little &#34;prophetic&#34; things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew\&#39;s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, &#34;Haven\&#39;t you read?&#34; for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no &#34;perfect praise&#34;\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\&#39;d,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew\&#39;s pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       &#34;The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.&#34;\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\&#39;s tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus\&#39;s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\&#39;s\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\&#39;s time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\&#39;s advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH\&#39;s utterance to my lord:\n\t&#34;Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.&#34;\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       &#34;You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.&#34;\n\nThe word &#34;lord&#34; is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is &#34;adoni,&#34; and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n&#34;lord,&#34; a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\&#39;d.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either &#34;a psalm of David,&#34; or &#34;a psalm about\nDavid.&#34;  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David\&#39;s covenant and endorsement from G\&#39;d.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David\&#39;s age.  We have extensive\ntales of David\&#39;s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\&#39;d had put his show of\nfavour for David\&#39;s kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G\&#39;d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\&#39;s question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses &amp; Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John\&#39;s gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus\&#39;s career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G\&#39;d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John\&#39;s little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter\&#39;s\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, &#34;It isn\&#39;t lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.&#34;  So they... bought a potter\&#39;s field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       &#34;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\&#39;s\n       field, as the lord directed me.&#34;\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, &#34;Cast\n       them to the treasury,&#34; --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G\&#39;d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G\&#39;d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, &#34;treasury,&#34; had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with &#34;to the potter,&#34; precisely because this made\nMatthew\&#39;s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed &#34;treasury,&#34; which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\&#39;s context, whereas &#34;potter\&#39;s\nfield&#34; is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew\&#39;s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\&#39;s situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe &#34;prophecy&#34; as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\&#39;s work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n&amp; Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       &#34;They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.&#34;\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, &#34;I thirst.&#34;  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, &#34;It is finished;&#34;\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the &#34;Jesus&#34; in the\npsalm asks G\&#39;d for the damnation of the &#34;crucifiers,&#34; whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, &#34;Father, forgive them, the\n       don\&#39;t know what they do!&#34;\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\&#39;s drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the &#34;prophecy&#34; of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, &#34;What of the casting of lots?&#34;  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus\&#39;s clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus\&#39;s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don\&#39;t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like &#34;the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.&#34;  Indeed, Jesus doesn\&#39;t do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  &#34;He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.&#34;\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus\&#39;s execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\&#39;m sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words &#34;have pierced&#34; really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase &#34;like the lion&#34; and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean &#34;pierced&#34; differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, &#34;like the lion&#34; (ka\&#39;ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to &#34;ka\&#39;aru.&#34;   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the &#34;prophecy&#34; this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm\&#39;s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn\&#39;t say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\&#39;t bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus\&#39;s life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been &#34;enhanced&#34; by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\&#39;s\ncrucifixion.  John\&#39;s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\&#39;s execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       &#34;The will look on him whom they\&#39;ve pierced.&#34;\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn\&#39;s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew\&#39;s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John\&#39;s errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\x0c\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       &#34;He was reckoned with the transgressors.&#34;\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the &#34;prophecy&#34; in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how &#34;those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.&#34; [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, &#34;Aren\&#39;t you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!&#34;\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark\&#39;s recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, &#34;Save yourself!&#34; and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       &#34;Don\&#39;t you fear G\&#39;d, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       &#34;Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.&#34; \n       And Jesus answered, &#34;Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.&#34;\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\&#39;t seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\&#39;s recount also disagrees with Mark\&#39;s.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G\&#39;d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\&#39;s\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, &#34;I am the christ.&#34;  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn\&#39;t know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, &#34;this generation\nshall not pass away...&#34; really means &#34;this race of people will not\npass away...&#34;  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn\&#39;t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles\&#39; responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\&#39;t in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.&#39;,

A genocide of Armenians took place\nduring peacetime.\n\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn\&#39;t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn\&#39;t go into people\&#39;s apartments. About five o\&#39;clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\&#39;t know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there\&#39;s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, &#34;What\&#39;s going on? What\&#39;s \nhappened?&#34; They say, &#34;Armenians, get out of here!&#34; We don\&#39;t open the door, we \nsay, &#34;If we have to leave, we\&#39;ll leave, we\&#39;ll leave tomorrow.&#34; They say, &#34;No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!&#34; By now they\&#39;ve \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: &#34;What\&#39;s with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?&#34;\nShe says, &#34;What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!&#34; My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n&#34;The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.&#34; He says, &#34;You \ndon\&#39;t need to shout, stop shouting.&#34; And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\&#39;t \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, &#34;We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences.&#34; They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\&#39;ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o\&#39;clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, &#34;Leave everything just how it is, we\&#39;re coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.&#34;\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor\&#39;s.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that\&#39;s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren\&#39;t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. &#34;They\&#39;re up there, still,\nup there. Let\&#39;s go kill them!&#34; They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, &#34;No, that\&#39;s from some of the \nfurniture.&#34; Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\&#39;clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, &#34;Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\&#39;t you now they\&#39;re checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!&#34; And to us :&#34; . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!&#34; We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\&#39;. At\nfirst the man didn\&#39;t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\&#39;clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\&#39;s, my brother\&#39;s, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn\&#39;t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn\&#39;t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \&#39;\npick up Father\&#39;s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\&#39;clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\&#39;s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\&#39;s body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn\&#39;t tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people\&#39;s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI\&#39;m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\&#39;t even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren\&#39;t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren\&#39;t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors\&#39; and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone\&#39;s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the &#34;operation&#34; was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\&#39;s leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don\&#39;t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\&#39;s how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

  &#34;I haven&#39;t seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.\n\nMaine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game.\nMaine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away\nwith it.  Maine&#39;s first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.\nLSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.\n\nLSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.\nThe play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.\nLSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.\nNow it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.\n\nCoach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won\nthe game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.\nThe third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored\nthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.\nThey were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by\nPaul Kariya.\n\nThe last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also\nproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU\ngoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by\nboth.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.\n\nThis year&#39;s three championships games were sold out last year in about one\nmonth.  The Bradley Center holds approximately 17,700.  \n&#34;,
  &#39;Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies\nof the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what\nit said about self-defense with a firearm.\n\n      I haven\&#39;t ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple\nof things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of\nweapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to &#34;weapon.&#34;\nThe second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun\ndefenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there\&#39;s an explanation for\nthis, I\&#39;m tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going \nahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.\n\n      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and\nnot just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn\&#39;t appear to have\nchanged significantly between 1986 and 1987.\n&#39;,

  &#39;\nNot particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably\nmore valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he\n*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty\ncanal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more\nthan *because of* him.\n\n\nUmm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,\nwhere the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure\nof better. The concept is called &#34;context&#34;, and you should really become\nfamiliar with it someday.\n\n\nUnless this transaltes to &#34;Clemens hasn\&#39;t gone into Lou Gorman\&#39;s office with\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he\&#39;d been traded to\nthe Jays,&#34; I\&#39;m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\n\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has &#34;won&#34; 68% of\nthe games he\&#39;s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\&#39; career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\n\n\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I\&#39;d really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow &#34;learn how to win&#34; in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nSooner than you expect. Remember \&#39;Cyprus\&#39;?\n\n\nToo bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established \na vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two \ncontinents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and \nWaffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in \nespionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and \nArabian Peninsula. They were promised an \&#39;independent\&#39; state under \nGerman \&#39;protection\&#39; in an agreement signed by the \&#39;Armenian National \nCouncil.\&#39; (A copy of this agreement can be found in the \&#39;Congressional \nRecord,\&#39; November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, \nNazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often \nexpressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,\nduring World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and\ncringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication\nin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]\n\n&#34;Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)\n when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it \n becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon\n method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Armenians should look to their own history and see \n  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...\n  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise \n  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would \n  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of\n  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

  &#39;\n\n\nIt seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar\nand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,\nkept harping about how they &#34;must have had a different view upstairs&#34;\nbecause it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who\nsaw the replay, that the puck didn\&#39;t go in.

  &#39;Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?\n\nLast Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.\nI took him to a local &#34;Urgent and General Care&#34; clinic at 5:50 pm.  The \nclinic was open till 6:00 pm.

During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several \ntrips to the back room, the receptionist told me:\n\t- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,\n\t- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going\n\t  to the emergency room;\n\t- the doctor would not even speak to me;\n\t- she would not tell me the doctor\&#39;s name, or her own name;\n\t- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said &#34;I don\&#39;t know.&#34;\n\nI realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but\nI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to\nbe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I\&#39;m still \ntrying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a \nletter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.\n&#39;,

  &#39;\nLast I checked I was one person, I haven\&#39;t even been elected\nas a representative for &#34;gaydom&#34;. Should I ascribe every thing\nyou say as representing every member of the straight community?\n\n\nThats the point.

  &#34;\nUmm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning&#39;&#39;.\nThe SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple\nencryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I&#39;d love to see how they&#39;d\nmandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)&#34;,
  &#34;\nI bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the\nmenu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in\nPC&#39;s that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input\nvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code\nto update the date after midnight never gets called. \n\nSomebody might be able to correct the details in case I&#39;ve mis-rememberred\nthem, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)\nor add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock\nkeeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS&#39;s clock).&#34;,
  &#39;Taft Electronics, 45th Street between 5th &amp; 6th -- the only one left in\nwhat was once an entire district of electronics stores.  A little expensive.\n\nTrans-Am Electronics, Canal Street near 7th Ave -- lots of surplus type\nstuff.\n\nSeveral other electronics or &#34;surplus&#34; type places are still on Canal\nStreet.\n\nI think Bronx Wholesale Radio is still in business -- Fordham Road not\ntoo far from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Also in the Bronx is NorthEastern\n(or was it Northwestern?  Northeast Electronics?) on Jerome Avenue near\nBedford Park Boulevard.  They\&#39;re mostly a TV parts supply house, but when\nI was building CB radio projects, they were quite handy..&#39;,
  &#34;\n\nI don&#39;t think so at first,  but solid state offered  better reliabity,\nid bet,  and any lower costs would be only after the processes really scaled up.&#34;,

  &#39;Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for\nstraying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:\n\n\nI never thought of these two ideas being &#34;against&#34; each other.\nPeople might quibble about what &#34;intrinsically&#34; means but the\nreason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we\nare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,\nbut great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a \ndifferent technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do\nnot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking \non water until a little doubt crept in.\n\nDoesn\&#39;t David ask in the 8th Psalm &#34;what is man that you [God] \nshould care for him, but you have made him just a little lower \nthan the angels&#34;?\n\nI probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David\nwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath\nwas, but David\&#39;s power easily defeated Goliath\&#39;s.\n\nRemember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what\nhe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.\nI always picture the smug look on his face as he says he\&#39;s done that\nhis whole life, probably anticipating an &#34;attaboy&#34; from the \nMessiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything\nand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say\nhow can anyone do this if it\&#39;s so hard even for rich people.\nJesus says anyone can do it, with God\&#39;s help.\n\nJesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid\ngetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing\nadultery, we can control our own desires. \n\nI realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other\npeople see this. \n\n\n(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)\n\nYour point about how &#34;hard&#34; other religions are is a good one, just \nas your &#34;Parting Question&#34; is a tough question. I think that Muslims\nworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name &#34;submission&#34;.\nHindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that &#34;God&#34; is impersonal. \nIs God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little\nmore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater \nto be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but\nyou\&#39;re right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more\nI must admit that God\&#39;s personal nature is as far beyond my\nconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu\&#39;s\nconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology\nthen maybe I wouldn\&#39;t have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.\n\nAre there any former (or present) &#34;Eastern Religion&#34; members here \nwho could comment?&#39;,
  &#39;I\&#39;ve had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now.\nIt is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the\nnewer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my\n8060.  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial &#34;analog&#34; to the Simpson 260\nanalog DMM of the 1950-1960s.  There was/is (?) an 8060B that had\nextended frequency response.\n\nI\&#39;ve got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep\nin my toolbox at home.  I\&#39;ve had that for six or seven years now\nand only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than\nadequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff\nfor a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices\&#39; stuff looks\nrather similar to Soar\&#39;s.\n\n&#39;,

  &#39;Howdy\n\nWe have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with\n4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don\&#39;t think \nParadox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok\n(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell\nnetwork (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program\nwill not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%\nand we then either get a \&#39;invalid command.com\&#39; or a windows nastygram\ntalking about an illegal instruction.  I\&#39;ve checked out the command.com\nthing, but as a long-time C programmer, I\&#39;ve crashed my share of machines\nwith pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)\n\nAnyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have\nquattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours\nwith Borland\&#39;s tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft\ndidn\&#39;t want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.\nSomewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You\&#39;d think\nwith all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all\nthe possible problems, but I guess not...\n\nMicrosoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General\nProtection faults (sorry, I can\&#39;t fax anything out of here so please\ndon\&#39;t ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they\nsaid, and still no luck.\n\nSo.  If you can help, please mail me.  This problem is driving us nuts.\nI will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.\n\nThanks\n\nKelly\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHIS IS THE REAL SIGNATURE...Please ignore the following demon signature..\n\nKelly J.

  &#39;\nThe Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that\n&#34;the people&#34; is a term of art refering to an individual right, and\nhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.\n\nI quote:\n\n  &#34;... \&#39;the people\&#39; seems to have been a term of art employed in\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by \&#39;the people of the\n  the U.S.\&#39;  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\n  to keep and bear Arms ....&#34;\n\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\n\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\ninterpretation.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\n\n &#34;The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.&#34;\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\n\nYou might rightfully ask &#34;well then, what does that first bit about\nmilitias mean?&#34;\n\nWell, &#34;militia&#34; in historical context basically means the whole of the\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\n&#34;militia&#34; as all armed men over the age of 17).\n\n   &#34;The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\n    the kind in common use at the time.&#34;\n\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   &#34;No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.&#34;\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).\n\n   &#34;And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not\n   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of\n   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.&#34;\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\n\n   &#34;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme\n   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;\n   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute\n   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on\n   any pretense, raised in the United States.&#34;\n     - Noah Webster, &#34;An Examination into the Leading Principles\n       of the Federal Constitution&#34; (1787), in Pamphlets on the\n       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n\nYou may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be\nrepealed, but please do not pretend that it isn\&#39;t there and that it\ndoesn\&#39;t mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have\nchanged and that it should no longer be present, but you can\&#39;t imagine\nit away.\n\nI could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.\n\nHowever, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get\nit out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in\ntalk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with\nyou.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com&#39;,

  &#39;\n\nall of my HO\&#39;s disagree with your HO\&#39;s.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..\ndetested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,\nDalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might\nbe of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift\ngears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is\ngood up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..\nit\&#39;s not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..\nonly shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,\nunless you drive a ferrari or some such, i\&#39;d bet) or when you hit cruising \nspeed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the \npassanger seat complaining about how you wind her &#34;poor little engine&#34; way\ntoo hi :-)\nJust my HO\&#39;s..&#39;,

  &#39;Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of \nmy least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least \nfavorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a \ngreat start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.\n\nBig Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be\nhitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots\nof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\nLankford and Zeile\&#39;s off year).\n\nI don\&#39;t know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \nand we\&#39;ll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\ndifference.\n\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied &#34;Fair.&#34;  I \nremember it being in the &#34;They Said It&#34; section of Sports Illustrated.\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\n\nGO REDBIRDS!!&#39;,
  &#34;I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it&#39;s\nget value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am\nnot using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).\n\nAnyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will\ncall their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around\nthis (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don&#39;t think)\ncall the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don&#39;t have the value for\nthe third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  \n\nIn other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.\n\nAny ideas anyone?  \n&#34;,

  &#39;\nJB&gt;    RR&gt; &#34;I don\&#39;t doubt that the placebo effect is alive and well with\nJB&gt;    RR&gt;  EVERY medical modality - estimated by some to be around 20+%,\nJB&gt;    RR&gt;  but why would it be higher with alternative versus conventional\nJB&gt;    RR&gt;  medicine?&#34;\nJB&gt;  \nJB&gt;  Because most the the time, closer to 90% in my experience, there is no\nJB&gt;  substance to the \&#39;alternative\&#39; intervention beyond the good intentions of the\nJB&gt;  practitioner, which in itself is quite therapeutic.

  &#39;My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model.\nIt was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the\nmountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I\nhave read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. \n\nI\&#39;m quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said &#34;once\nit\&#39;s broken in it will feel more powerful&#34;. I had been used to driving a\nJeep 4.0L 190hp engine. I believe the 92\&#39;s Land Cruisers (Land Yachts)\nwere 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my\nown personal opinion). \n\nThey are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.\n&#39;,

  &#34;\nI think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\nlack the references.\n\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\nthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes\nthis position, but that&#39;s because he takes the very small minority view\nthat Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of\nbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to\nthe historicity of Jesus.)&#34;,
  &#39;Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\n\n\nand \n\n\nActually, if you do further research as to the Greek word &#34;apacgw,&#34; you will\nfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t&#34;Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,&#34; Louw and Nida\n\t&#34;Robinson\&#39;s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament&#34;\n\t&#34;Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,&#34; Grimm\n\t&#34;Word study Concordance,&#34; Tynsdale\n\t&#34;A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,&#34; Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t&#34;The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,&#34; Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated &#34;hanged oneself&#34;, and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that &#34;apacgw&#34; means specifically &#34;kill yourself by hanging.&#34; A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for &#34;apacgw&#34; is\n&#34;strangle, throttle or choke&#34; (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, &#34;Robinson\&#39;s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,&#34; not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word &#34;apagchw&#34; has two root words: &#34;gchw&#34; is the &#34;to strangle&#34; root, and\nthe root word &#34;apo&#34; means literally &#34;away.&#34; This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word &#34;apagello&#34; means to send a message).  &#34;Apo&#34; can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word &#34;apokteiuo,&#34; which means &#34;to kill.&#34;\nIn literal meaning the word &#34;apacgw&#34; means &#34;to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,&#34; and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word &#34;apacgw&#34; does mean &#34;to hang,&#34; it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means &#34;to hang oneself, to end one\&#39;s life by hanging.&#34; He then\nnotes the the use of &#34;apacgw&#34; in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of &#34;apacgw&#34; as being used to explicitly mean &#34;suicide by\nhanging.&#34; Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of &#34;death,&#34; and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of &#34;apacgw&#34; (ie: Since the word &#34;apacgw&#34; was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of &#34;apacgw&#34;:\n\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie&#34; the the\nHebrew say &#34;and died&#34;), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added &#34;and died&#34;, the\ncorrect translation would still be &#34;apacgw,&#34; as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n&#34;apacgw&#34; and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\&#39;s statement about trees around the Potter\&#39;s Field:\n\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\&#39; betrayal\n&#34;an iniquity,&#34; but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\&#39;\nactions &#34;an iniquity&#34; either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\n\n    &#34;Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him &#34;Buy what we need for the feast&#34;; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.&#34;\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that &#34;apacgw&#34; means suicide.  You see, since Judas\&#39; hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the &#34;Field of Blood&#34; would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\&#39;t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\&#39;s field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\&#39;s all part of the same verse we\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \nthese issues.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n\t\t\t\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\n\t\t\t\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding&#39;,

  &#39;Sorry for posting this, but my e-mail keeps bouncing.  Maybe it will\nhelp others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is\nactually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.\n\n     I\&#39;m posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail\naccess.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\n\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\n\n     I don\&#39;t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\n\n     I don\&#39;t call it spanking because it\&#39;s more of a reaction to something\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\nnot been spanked yet.\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\&#39;re still loved.\n\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\&#39;s too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you\&#39;re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It\&#39;s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn\&#39;t play together for 5 days so he\&#39;d know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He\&#39;s never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\&#39;t keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it\&#39;s hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\&#39;t be over until they\ncalm down if they\&#39;re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\&#39;re\nreally young.\n\n     40\n\n     Bath, Ohio.  It\&#39;s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\n\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\&#39;t always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\&#39;s have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\&#39;s law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that &#34;what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.&#34;  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\&#39;ll admit I\&#39;ve been tempted with\nat times.  When I\&#39;ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil\&#39;s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\&#39;s\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.&#39;,

The split\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\nand after a specific date.\n\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\nextractor.\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    =================   ==========\n    Classes                     20\n    Samples total            18846\n    Dimensionality               1\n    Features                  text\n    =================   ==========\n\nUsage\n~~~~~\n\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\n  [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.graphics\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.os.ms-windows.misc\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.sys.mac.hardware\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.windows.x\&#39;,\n   \&#39;misc.forsale\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.autos\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.motorcycles\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.sport.baseball\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.sport.hockey\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.crypt\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.electronics\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.med\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.space\&#39;,\n   \&#39;soc.religion.christian\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.guns\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.mideast\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.misc\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.religion.misc\&#39;]\n\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\n\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\nlist of the categories to load to the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; cats = [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;, categories=cats)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n\nConverting text to vectors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\nfrom a subset of 20news::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; categories = [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;talk.religion.misc\&#39;,\n  ...               \&#39;comp.graphics\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;,\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.shape\n  (2034, 34118)\n\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\n  159.01327...\n\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\n\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\n\n\nFiltering text for more realistic training\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\naren\&#39;t from this window of time.\n\nFor example, let\&#39;s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn import metrics\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;test\&#39;,\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.88213...\n\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\nyet of what\&#39;s going on inside this classifier?)\n\nLet\&#39;s take a look at what the most informative features are:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\n  ...         print(&#34;%s: %s&#34; % (category, &#34; &#34;.join(feature_names[top10])))\n  ...\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\n\n\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\n\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\n- The word &#34;article&#34; is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\n  previous posts like this: &#34;In article [article ID], [name] &lt;[e-mail address]&gt;\n  wrote:&#34;\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\n  were posting at the time.\n\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\nsame high level.\n\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\n``(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;)``, telling it to remove headers, signature\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;test\&#39;,\n  ...                                      remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;),\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.77310...\n\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;,\n  ...                                       remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;),\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.76995...\n\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\n\n.. topic:: Recommendation\n\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\n  setting ``remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;)``. The F-score will be\n  lower because it is more realistic.\n\n.. topic:: Examples\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\n&#39;}</pre>

The first one,\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\nextractor.\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    =================   ==========\n    Classes                     20\n    Samples total            18846\n    Dimensionality               1\n    Features                  text\n    =================   ==========\n\nUsage\n~~~~~\n\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\n  [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.graphics\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.os.ms-windows.misc\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.sys.mac.hardware\&#39;,\n   \&#39;comp.windows.x\&#39;,\n   \&#39;misc.forsale\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.autos\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.motorcycles\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.sport.baseball\&#39;,\n   \&#39;rec.sport.hockey\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.crypt\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.electronics\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.med\&#39;,\n   \&#39;sci.space\&#39;,\n   \&#39;soc.religion.christian\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.guns\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.mideast\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.politics.misc\&#39;,\n   \&#39;talk.religion.misc\&#39;]\n\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\n\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\nlist of the categories to load to the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; cats = [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;, categories=cats)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n\nConverting text to vectors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\nfrom a subset of 20news::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; categories = [\&#39;alt.atheism\&#39;, \&#39;talk.religion.misc\&#39;,\n  ...               \&#39;comp.graphics\&#39;, \&#39;sci.space\&#39;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;,\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.shape\n  (2034, 34118)\n\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\n  159.01327...\n\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\n\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\n\n\nFiltering text for more realistic training\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\naren\&#39;t from this window of time.\n\nFor example, let\&#39;s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn import metrics\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;test\&#39;,\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.88213...\n\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\nyet of what\&#39;s going on inside this classifier?)\n\nLet\&#39;s take a look at what the most informative features are:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\n  ...         print(&#34;%s: %s&#34; % (category, &#34; &#34;.join(feature_names[top10])))\n  ...\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\n\n\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\n\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\n- The word &#34;article&#34; is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\n  previous posts like this: &#34;In article [article ID], [name] &lt;[e-mail address]&gt;\n  wrote:&#34;\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\n  were posting at the time.\n\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\nsame high level.\n\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\n``(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;)``, telling it to remove headers, signature\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;test\&#39;,\n  ...                                      remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;),\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.77310...\n\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&#39;train\&#39;,\n  ...                                       remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;),\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&#39;macro\&#39;)\n  0.76995...\n\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\n\n.. topic:: Recommendation\n\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\n  setting ``remove=(\&#39;headers\&#39;, \&#39;footers\&#39;, \&#39;quotes\&#39;)``. The F-score will be\n  lower because it is more realistic.\n\n.. topic:: Examples\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\n&#39;</pre>
